" This improvement underpins our view that volume growth will surprise on the upside , " said JPMorgan , which repeated an " overweight " rating .
Cadbury looked to be faring worse , the broker said .
It thought Cadbury 's UK sales had been sharply below company targets since July .
JPMorgan added that Cadbury has cranked up its promotions after last month 's bid from Kraft , so a sales miss looked unlikely .

For the week the index rose 3.5 per cent , thanks largely to the falling US dollar .

Earnings worries put pressure on Unilever as miners lift FTSE 100
Earnings worries put Unilever among London 's biggest fallers yesterday .
Weaker emerging markets meant Unilever 's sales growth was likely to undershoot market expectations , said Oriel Securities .
" Unilever 's 57 per cent exposure to emerging markets , while strategically desirable for long-term growth , renders the company vulnerable to organic sales growth disappointment , " said Oriel .
Analysts expect the group to deliver 5.5 per cent organic growth when it reports second-quarter results next week , down from 5.7 per cent from the same period last year .
However , growth across its markets seems to have slowed by about a percentage point since a year ago and , while Unilever can still outpace peers , the weather-related warning from Coca-Cola this week suggested an extra risk to ice cream sales , Oriel said .
Yet Unilever 's valuation has risen to a 10-year high , putting it at a wide premium to peers on earnings ratios , said Credit Suisse .
" There is a lot more to do in both household and food , " it said .
" The former has delivered better growth , but at a cost to returns .
The latter has seen growth slow sharply and market shares come under pressure .
More investment is needed . "
Credit Suisse downgraded Unilever to " underperform " , pulling the stock 1.6 per cent lower at pound(s)27.56.
A rally among the miners helped the FTSE 100 edge up 0.2 per cent or 15.58 points to 6,571.93.
Glencore added 2.8 per cent to 272p , while BHP Billiton advanced 2 per cent to pound(s)18.68 after it raised iron ore production guidance .
Hochschild rallied 7.4 per cent to 146.2p after the silver miner axed two nonexecutive directors and announced pay cuts for other board members .
Marks and Spencer led the blue-chip risers , up 2.8 per cent to 473.6p.
A retread of bid theories helped the shares , as did industry data earlier in the week showing M&S 's grocery sales spiking higher over the past month .
Thomas Cook rose 2.7 per cent to 146.5p after UBS added the stock to its " buy " list , in spite of its threefold rise already this year .
" 2013 has to date been an almost perfect environment for tour operators , " said UBS .
It argued that poor weather in spring , capacity discipline among European airlines and favourable foreign exchange movements meant pricing was likely to remain strong for the year .
Salamander Energy bounced 6.6 per cent to 135.9p , having been weak over the previous two sessions on news of a dry well off the Thailand coast .
Goldman Sachs moved its share price target to 363p and argued that , if the rest of Salamander 's 2013 drilling campaign was 100 per cent successful , it could add 430p to that valuation .
Essar Energy edged up 2 per cent to 211p after JPMorgan Cazenove highlighted moves by India to deregulate its gas market .
Essar was leveraged to higher Indian gas prices via its coal bed methane output , so a free market could boost operating earnings 6 per cent next year , it said .
Invensys took on 1 per cent to 507p after Bernstein analysts argued that General Electric might have the scale to trump Schneider 's 505p offer by paying up to 570p a share for the engineer .
Separately , hedge fund ValueAct Capital cut its stake in Invensys to 6.7 per cent , down from 8 per cent before of the bid .
Smiths Group faded 1 per cent to pound(s)13.77 after the engineer warned of a pound(s)15m hit to earnings from continuing problems with legacy contracts at its detection division .
A mixed update pulled Land Securities 2.5 per cent lower at 945p .
Capita faded 1.8 per cent to pound(s)10.36 , with RBC downgrading to " underperform " .
Imperial Tobacco lost 2.5 per cent to pound(s)21.97 as it began trading without a 35.2p dividend , and after Natixis cut it from its " buy " list .

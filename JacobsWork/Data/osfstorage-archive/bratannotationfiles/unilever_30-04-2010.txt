Unilever
Unilever has seen a few false dawns , but this time the faint glow in the east may just broaden into a sunlit morning .
Like all the best chief executives , Paul Polman - in place for five quarters now - is benefiting in part from his predecessor 's actions .
Patrick Cescau turned Unilever into something looking less like the civil service and more like a lean , responsive consumer goods company .
Mr Polman is taking advantage of that to push for aggressive innovation and volume-led growth .
The Anglo-Dutch company 's impressive 7.6 per cent first-quarter volume growth beat both US arch-rivals that also reported on Thursday - Procter & Gamble ( 7 per cent ) and Colgate-Palmolive ( 6 per cent ) .
True , it was achieved against feeble prior-year comparisons , and with prices down 3.3 per cent , year on year - though the price cuts had already been made in 2009 .
Strikingly , however , Unilever increased its operating margin by 60 basis points ( P&G 's was up by 80bps ) , while delivering a hefty increase in advertising and promotional spending - worth 220bp of sales .
It is achieving the rare feat of increasing volumes , expanding margins and beefing up support for its brands , simultaneously .
Unilever is being helped by lower commodity prices , which will reverse in the second half .
Toughening comparisons will also make it difficult to sustain such robust reported volume gains .
But the latest quarterly figures will reinforce investor confidence that the underlying momentum can be maintained .
Meanwhile , the sheen dimmed a little this week on domestic rival Reckitt Benckiser , whose first-quarter figures failed , uncharacteristically , to meet expectations .
Despite a subsequent sell-off , Reckitt 's shares still trade at a small premium to Unilever's .
As the sky brightens over Unilever , that gap should continue to narrow .

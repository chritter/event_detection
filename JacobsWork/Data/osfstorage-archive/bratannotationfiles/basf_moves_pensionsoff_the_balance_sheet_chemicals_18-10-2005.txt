BASF moves pensionsoff the balance sheet CHEMICALS
BASF , the world 's largest chemicals company , is to use Euros 3.7bn ( Dollars 4.5bn ) in cash to move pension liabilities off balance sheet , copying a slew of other German companies trying to improve transparency .
The move could reduce the short-term chances of the group making an acquisition or paying a special dividend but BASF said its options remained open .
It was warmly received by analysts and rating agencies , who said it would improve comparisons of BASF 's balance sheet with competitors and reduce volatility .
Pension liabilities have been in focus at German companies since Thyssen-Krupp saw its credit rating downgraded to junk by Standard & Poor 's two years ago as their debt-like nature meant the conglomerate was more stretched financially than thought .
Most German groups accounted for their liabilities on the balance sheet , often leading to fluctuations as their value varied widely .
But in recent years many blue-chips have moved some or all their liabilities into so-called contractual trust agreements ( CTAs ) , which treat them as debt off the balance sheet .
BASF said yesterday it would move Euros 3.7bn into a CTA to finance Euros 2.9bn in BASF AG 's liabilities .
The group as a whole has pension liabilities of Euros 3.9bn.
The move will be financed from its cash pile , which amounted to Euros 3bn at the end of the first half , and cashflow , with analysts from HVB expecting Euros 2.5bn this year plus an extra Euros 1bn from the sale of Basell .
Andreas Heine at HVB wrote : " In view of estimated free cashflow of Euros 2.5bn-Euros 3bn in 2006 , the room for larger dividends and share buybacks is very high and not cramped by the CTA . "

Barclays shows its reliance on investment bank arm
Barclays showed its continued dependency on investment banking as a rise in the unit 's profits cushioned a 25 per cent fall in group returns in the first quarter .
Profits in the investment banking arm accounted for three quarters of adjusted pre-tax profit of pound(s)1.79bn after rising by 11 per cent in the first three months .
Under Antony Jenkins , chief executive , the lender is cutting thousands of jobs and has promised a cultural change at the scandal-hit bank but has resisted political calls to drastically curb the investment bank .
Analysts said the results showed how Barclays ' business focus remained mostly unchanged from the era of Bob Diamond , its former chief executive .
James Chappell , at Berenberg Bank , said : " Despite the rhetoric from management , Barclays remains dependent on the investment bank for profits and its good performance . "
Ian Gordon , analyst at Investec Securities , said : " Ignore the excruciating references to Barclays as the ' go-to ' bank - these are results of which Sir Bob would be proud . "
The shares fell 1 per cent to 294.55p after the statement , which with Credit Suisse began the reporting season for Europe 's banks and preceded Barclays ' annual meeting today .
The overhaul initiated by Mr Jenkins cost pound(s)514m in the first three months of 2013 , which damped earnings alongside rising losses at its European retail and business bank where most of the restructuring charges where booked .
Mr Jenkins is cutting Barclays ' continental European retail and business bank by shedding 1,900 jobs .

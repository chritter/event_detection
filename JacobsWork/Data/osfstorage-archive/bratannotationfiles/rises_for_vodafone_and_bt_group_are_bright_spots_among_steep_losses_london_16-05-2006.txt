Rises for Vodafone and BT Group are bright spots among steep losses LONDON

Vodafone , up 1.2 per cent to 125 1/4p , and BT Group,2.6 per cent higher at 216p , both closed in positive territory as the FTSE 100 finished at its lowest level since mid-March .
Traders attributed their strong performances to sector rotation and nervous hedge funds closing long-held short positions .

" Buying back short positions in the telecoms sector is a logical place to start given these stocks have underperformed and are unlikely to fall muchfurther . "
That said , Vodafone was supported by UBS , which increased its target price to 153p and encouraged investors to " buy " ahead of the company 's eagerly awaited strategy update on May 30 .
BT Group drew support from reports that it would announce a smaller-than-expected pension fund deficit with full-year figures on Thursday .

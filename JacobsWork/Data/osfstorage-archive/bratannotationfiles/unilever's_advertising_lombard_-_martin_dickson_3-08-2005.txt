Unilever 's advertising LOMBARD - MARTIN DICKSON
The 9 per cent earnings growth reported by Procter & Gamble on Monday has set the context for Unilever 's second-quarter results tomorrow .
But not in a good way .
On the contrary , the continued strength of P&G underlines the competitive challenge faced by Unilever as the new management continues its task of bringing sustainable growth to the food and consumer goods group .
Unilever 's figures will be helped by the weak comparative from Europe last year , when poor weather hit sales .
And the performance from emerging markets is expected to be robust .
Even so , although the range of analysts ' forecasts is wide , some are expecting no more than 1.5 per cent underlying sales growth , which would represent a slowdown in momentum compared with the first quarter .
While analysts are divided about the forecasts , they are united in seeking greater clarity from the group about its investment in advertising and promotions .
This is an important area where Unilever could help itself .
The group 's retreat from the frequent updates and external targets of the Path to Growth years is understandable and sensible .
The desire not to cut earnings targets , even as missed sales targets made them increasingly ambitious , appears to have been a factor in the failure to invest enough in the group 's most powerful brands .
But Unilever does not have to box itself in to targets that might restrict its flexibility and give useful information to rivals to provide more data about what it has spent on advertising and promotions to date .
In a recovery story as long as Unilever 's looks set to be , such information would give valuable comfort to investors along the way .

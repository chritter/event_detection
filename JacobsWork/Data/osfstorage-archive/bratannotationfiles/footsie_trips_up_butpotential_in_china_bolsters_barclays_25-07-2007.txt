Footsie trips up butpotential in China bolsters Barclays
By NEIL HUME and ROBERT ORR
Barclays was one of just five FTSE 100 companies to close in positive territory yesterday as the blue chip index suffered its biggest one-day percentage fall since mid-March .
Its shares improved 0.5 per cent to 738 1/2p after Cazenove , house broker , highlighted the earnings potential of Barclays ' strategic agreement with China Development Bank .
On Monday , CDB said it would take a Euros 2.2bn stake in Barclays and invest a further Euros 7.6bn if the UK bank 's bid for ABN Amro , a Dutch rival , was successful .
At a presentation , Barclays told Cazenove that it expected meaningful revenues from the agreement in 2008 , mainly through commodity products .
It pointed out that CDB was the vehicle through which the Chinese government would develop a commodities hedging market .
" Based on our 2010 forecasts , we estimate a Pounds 500m incremental pre-tax profit opportunity for Barclays or Pounds 800m for the combined group ( which includes ABN ) , " Cazenove said
Traders pointed out that , if Barclays shares reach 798p , its offer would achieve parity with the rival bid for ABN Amro .
In the wider market , leading shares fell sharply , unsettled by poor results from the US .
In particular , a profit warning from Countrywide , the biggest mortgage lender in the US , really hit sentiment .
The FTSE 100 closed down 125.7 points , or 1.9 per cent , at 6,498.7 while the FTSE 250 dropped 198.2 points , or 1.7 per cent , to 11,584 .
Man Group also managed to close in positive territory yesterday .
Its shares firmed up 0.7 per cent to 613 1/2p on talk that the hedge fund manager could be a takeover target for UBS , or another large investment bank , now that it has demerged its brokerage division .
Imperial Tobacco added 0.8 per cent to Pounds 23.13 as investors looked to defensive stocks .
Imperial benefited from speculation that the company would look to sell Logista , the logistics business that it will inherit if its Euros 12.6bn acquisition of Spanish rival Altadis goes ahead .
Citigroup , which lifted its target price on Imperial to Pounds 25.50 yesterday , said selling the business could generate Pounds 1.9bn and would leave Imperial requiring a Pounds 3bn rights issue to finance the Altadis deal .
Yell Group rose 0.7 per cent to 472 1/2p on relief that first- quarter results had met expectations .
On the downside , Royal Bank of Scotland was marked 2.1 per cent lower at 602 1/2p because of the warning from Countrywide .
Traders pointed out that Countrywide had blamed some of its woes on weakness in the prime mortgage market and that RBS had Dollars 53bn of exposure to mortgages and home equity in the US .
They also said there was negative read-across for HSBC , off 1.6 per cent at 887p .
Centrica faded 1.2 per cent to 375 1/4p in spite of Credit Suisse telling clients that earnings upgrades were likely to follow next week 's half-year results .
Sports Direct International , the sports wear re-tailer , provided the main talking point in the FTSE 250 as its shares slumped 22.6 per cent to 147p after maiden results disappointed and the company warned on profit for 2008 .
Sports Direct floated at 300p in February .
After the market closed , the company said it had bought back 3.8m shares at 148p .
FKI , the engineer , rallied 2.7 per cent to 113 1/4p on relief that takeover talks with an unnamed bidder were still on and trading remained in line with expectations .
Britvic , the soft drinks company that makes Robinsons fruit squash , improved 3.8 per cent to 354p after Deutsche Bank upgraded it to " buy " .
" While downgrades are likely for 2007 ( because of wet weather ) , we do not necessarily think that is the case for 2008 and 2009 , where we expect the group to report strong double-digit earnings growth , " it said .
Abbot Group , the oil field services group , eased 3.1 per cent to 283 1/2p in spite of hopes of further sector consolidation .
Overnight , Transocean , the world 's largest offshore drilling company , announ-ced an Dollars 18bn bid for smaller rival GlobalSantaFe .
" We think Abbot 's international market exposure would certainly be attractive for any North American driller looking to diversify its exposure , " ABN Amro said .

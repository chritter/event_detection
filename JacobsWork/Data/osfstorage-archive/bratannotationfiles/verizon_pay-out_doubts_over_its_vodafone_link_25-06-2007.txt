Verizon pay-out doubts over its Vodafone link
By ANDREW PARKER and PAUL TAYLOR
Verizon Communications , the second-largest US telecoms company , has cast doubt on whether Vodafone will get dividend payments from their US mobile phone joint venture any time soon by warning Verizon Wireless is " not close " to paying off its debt .
Verizon refused to confirm UK-based Vodafone 's statement last month that Verizon Wireless could resume dividends payments in about two years because the debt will have been cleared .
Denny Strigl , Verizon 's chief operating officer , said Verizon Wireless 's net debt stood at about Dollars 10bn .
" We are not close to paying that down , " he said in an interview with the Financial Times .
One rebel Vodafone shareholder criticised the company 's " passive investment " in Verizon Wireless this month .
Efficient Capital Structures is asking investors to vote at Vodafone 's annual meeting next month in favour of spinning off its stake in Verizon Wireless , or creating a tracker stock linked to it .
Verizon has management control of Verizon Wireless .
Asked whether Vodafone was correct to say Verizon Wireless could resume dividend payments in two years , Mr Strigl said : " I have no comment . "
Vodafone 's last dividend payments from Verizon Wireless were worth Dollars 923m .
They related to fiscal year 2004 and were received in March 2005 .
Verizon Wireless 's net debt stood at Dollars 11.3bn in September 2006 , which is the most recentfiling for the joint venture sent to US regulators .
Mr Strigl said Verizon had " moved on " from its efforts last year to buy Vodafone out of Verizon Wireless .
Vodafone has been unwilling to sell its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless unless offered a heftypremium .

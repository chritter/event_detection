Results lift Dow Chemical and BASF
chemicals ; Rising raw material costs absorbed ; Groups caution over pockets of weakness
Two of the world 's biggest manufacturers of chemicals reported solid results on Thursday as strong demand allowed them to pass on higher raw material costs to customers , but both cautioned about pockets of economic weakness .
Dow Chemical , the US group , reported a surge in third-quarter profits and revenues thanks in part to demand , particularly in emerging markets , for agricultural chemicals and compounds used in aluminium and paper production .
Meanwhile , BASF , the world 's biggest chemicals company , said sales rose 11.6 per cent to EUR17.6bn compared with the same period in 2010 , although disruptions to its Libyan oil operations dented profits .
The German group struck a cautious tone about the outlook , however , noting that volatility in international capital markets had led some of its clients to delay orders and reduce their inventories .
BASF cut its own forecasts for global economic growth in 2011 by about a percentage point to a range of 2.5-3 per cent .
Kurt Bock , chief executive , said the company would continue its cost saving programmes .
" We remain cautious despite the current good performance as economic growth is likely to slow further , " he said .
" Credit restrictions in China , as well as debt crises in Europe and the US will adversely impact growth . "
Dow gave a careful but slightly more upbeat outlook .
Andrew Liveris , chief executive of Dow , noted " ongoing volatility in the pace of global economic recovery , " but said the company was prepared for " jagged economic conditions over the near term " .
Mr Liveris said that Dow would be buoyed by its exposure to emerging markets and resilient sectors like agriculture and energy and added that cost-cutting measures and efforts to trim its working capital would boost cash flows by $750m next year .
In the third quarter , net income at Dow doubled to about $900m compared with the same period in 2010 , giving earnings per share of $0.69 , despite a $1.7bn rise in the cost of raw materials .
During the three months to the end of September , revenues jumped 17 per cent to $15.1bn , driven by strong sales in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region that offset declines in the US and Europe and allowed Dow to increase its prices by 17 per cent .
In midday US trading , Dow shares rose 9 per cent to about $29.21.
In Europe , BASF shares rose 8 per cent to EUR54.37 on Thursday .

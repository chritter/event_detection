Verizon cools Vodafone talk
LONDON
Vodafone lagged behind a buoyant London market yesterday after the group 's US joint-venture partner played down merger hopes .
The shares slid 1.4 per cent to 149 1/2 p after Ivan Seidenberg , Verizon 's chief executive , said a merger did n't " seem to have a lot of appeal " .
Vodafone shares added 3.4 per cent last week on news that it was in discussions about the future of its Verizon Wireless venture , which does not at present pay a dividend .
Mr Seidenberg told reporters at a meeting in Washington that , while Verizon would like to find a way to " resolve " Vodafone 's minority stake in the venture , a union was not on the agenda .
" This notion of a global wireless-only carrier is no longer the preferred model , " he said .
Energy companies and miners led the wider market , which played catch-up after the release of US jobs and manufacturing data over the Easter holiday .
The FTSE 100 rose to its highest level since June 2008 , up 35.46 points , or 0.6 per cent , to 5,780.34.
Oil majors provided 20 points of the FTSE 100 's advance as crude prices reached an 18-month high .
BP climbed 2.4 per cent to 646 1/4 p , and the B shares of Royal Dutch Shell added 1.7 per cent to pound(s)18.60.
Tullow Oil rose 2.4 per cent to pound(s)13.13 following a report that Korea National Oil Company was interested in buying a stake in its Jubilee field in Ghana .
ENRC led the miners , up 3.4 per cent to pound(s)12.66.
That followed European steelmakers agreeing a 35 per cent increase in ferrochrome pricing for the second quarter against the first , which was higher than analysts had expected .
Rio Tinto gained 1.4 per cent to pound(s)40.62 amid speculation its proposed iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton could fail amid growing regulatory hostility .
The recent surge in ore prices has also led some Rio shareholders to argue that the deal terms have moved too far in favour of BHP , up 1.5 per cent to pound(s)23.34 1/2 .

British Land beats forecasts
Real Estate
British Land , the UK 's second-biggest property company , reported solid growth in its pound(s)9.3bn estate on the back of strengthening values of its office developments and shopping centre portfolio .
The company 's properties rose 2.3 per cent in value in the third quarter to December 31 , which boosted net asset value 4.4 per cent to 548p a share .
This represents growth of 25 per cent over the past year in net asset value .
The results beat the benchmark index and were higher than analysts ' expectations .
Chris Grigg , chief executive , said that British Land had made good progress across the business in its leasing activity and had seen signs of resilience outside London in towns such as Rotherham .
The company remains focused on development of offices in London , where it is progressing with six schemes , and is also looking to buy properties outside the capital where it can add value .
British Land completed the purchase of a shopping centre in Barnstaple , Devon , this week .
Mr Grigg said : " There is more realism among vendors away from prime stuff , so for us it 's around finding value in a relatively complicated space .
There is more stuff coming across our desk and we are spotting value in individual transactions . "
Rental growth remained positive , with a 0.5 per cent rise in estimated rental values in line with the previous quarter .
Lettings in the quarter have been agreed significantly ahead of estimated rental value in both its retail and offices portfolio , indicating future ERV growth .
Pre-tax profit fell from pound(s)611m to pound(s)263m in the period .
Underlying profit , which strips out the revaluation of its portfolio , rose from pound(s)58m to pound(s)64m .
The shares fell 3 1/2 p to 543p .

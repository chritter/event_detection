Tesco chief to quit on solid note
Sir Terry Leahy , the outgoing chief executive of Tesco , is expected to bow out with a solid Christmas trading statement when the UK 's biggest supermarket chain by market share updates the market on Thursday , writes Andrea Felsted .
After a slew of profit warnings from retailers this week , the grocers are expected to prove more resilient .
However , Tesco will not be immune from the severe weather that swept the country in the weeks before Christmas .
Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , forecasts UK sales from stores open at least a year , excluding fuel and value added tax , to grow 1-2 per cent year on year for the six weeks to January 8 .
The update will come days after Tesco announced its new UK board as Philip Clarke , Sir Terry 's successor , makes his mark .

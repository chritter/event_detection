Barclays ' bond
Sometimes , symbolism is what counts .
Barclays is the first UK bank to test the market 's appetite for the government 's guarantee of bank debt .
The UK banking fraternity could not allow this to be a damp squib .
A lot is riding on the the knock-on effects this guarantee will , it is hoped , provide - less hysteria in money markets and more confidence in banks ' ability to procure term funding .
So British banks should be relieved to see Barclays ' EUR3bn three-year bond deal get away .
There are few ways institutional investors can get their hands on debt both guaranteed by the UK government and denominated in euros , which helped demand .
Barclays also gathered a cast of thousands ( well , five other banks ) to make a market in the bonds , thereby ensuring their liquidity .
For Barclays , the debt works out cheaper than if it had gone it alone , assuming it could have issued unguaranteed bonds of that maturity anyway .
True , Lloyds TSB did a bond issue last week without guarantee .
But it was smaller and the maturity longer , both important in current markets that unusually ascribe more credit risk to banks near-term than further out .
Is there a risk banks will become reliant on government-guaranteed ( also called agency ) debt ?
The question may seem a bit of a luxury , given that only 10 days ago banks could not get more than overnight funding .
The issue could resolve itself anyway as rising agency issuance will cause spreads to widen , making it a less cost-effective option for banks .
In any case , the pound(s)250bn in government guarantees is not that big a number compared with the vast money markets and retail deposits .
The point of the guarantee is not to substitute for such regular sources of bank funding but rather to provide a breather until normal service resumes .
Still , as symbols go , this one is a pretty powerful one .

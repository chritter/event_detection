BASF / Engelhard
After four fruitless months seeking a white knight to counter BASF 's takeover bid , Engelhard 's management has fallen back on that old favourite : a leveraged recapitalisation .
The Dollars 45 per share being offered for 20 per cent of the outstanding equity is a red herring .
Engelhard 's stock does not deserve a rating at parity to rival catalyst provider Johnson Matthey's .
This is a straight buyback - any " premium " to BASF 's Dollars 38 offer will wash through into a lower value for the remainder of Engelhard 's outstanding equity .
Standard & Poor 's has said the recap will probably cut Engelhard 's long-term credit rating to just above junk .
That leaves little margin for error during an important growth phase for the business .
Engelhard 's valuation case , based on earnings accretion , is also sensitive to the yield on the new debt as well as requiring Dollars 15m of promised annual cost savings .
The management 's decision to put the opposing offers to a shareholder vote is laudable .
Engelhard 's better-than-expected first- quarter results might even help its case .
Against that , however , is the fact that no other third party was prepared to top BASF 's offer .
Engelhard 's shares had gone nowhere in the years prior to BASF 's bid .
Investors are now being asked to accept that a more leveraged group under the same management can achieve a substantial , and sustainable , re-rating .
Some may hope the magic figure of Dollars 45 will draw BASF itself over the Dollars 40 line .
BASF would do well to resist the temptation .

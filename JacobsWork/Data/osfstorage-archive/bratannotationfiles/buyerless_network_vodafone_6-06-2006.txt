Buyerless network Vodafone
It 's a painful question , but here goes : is Vodafone , the acquisition machine , now itself a takeover candidate ?
Its market capitalisation of Dollars 140bn ranks ninth in the world .
After August 's jumbo dividends this falls to Dollars 119bn - and 34th place .
If Vodafone , as its critics demand , then sold its stake in Verizon wireless and distributed the post-tax proceeds , its value would drop to about Dollars 85bn .
That is outside the world 's top 50 companies and comparable to Barclays and AstraZeneca , two of the UK market 's favourite takeover candidates .
Further , Vodafone is unpopular with some investors and trades on a low 2006 earnings multiple of 12 times .
In spite of this , a takeover is unlikely .
There is no obvious buyer .
Most other industry operators have performed badly too .
Only AT&T , China Mobile and Verizon would be larger than a Dollars 90bn Vodafone .
China Mobile 's ambitions today are modest - it is sniffing around Millicom , an emerging markets shrimp .
AT&T has complementary technology but it would be perverse if the market , having chastised Vodafone 's US ambitions , supported expansion in the other direction .
Europe 's Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom can be ruled out .
Both have large debt loads and two big overlapping networks with Vodafone .
Fantasists in the private equity world may dream of breaking Vodafone up , but even at Dollars 90bn it would be too big .
Although Vodafone has exited Japan and may leave the US , the concept of a controlled , transnational mobile portfolio retains investor support .
Sir John Bond , the new chairman , helped build HSBC into the world 's third most valuable bank .
He is an unsentimental but ambitious man who will be keen to exploit a unique asset base .
Vodafone 's stature has diminished but if the operator did not exist , someone would still , probably , try to invent it .

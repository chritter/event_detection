Vodafone to write down pound(s)5.9bn over Europe woes
Vodafone has been forced to write down almost pound(s)6bn from its operations in southern Europe , taking the shine off a pound(s)2.4bn cash dividend from its stake in Verizon Wireless in the US .
The company will return more than 60 per cent of that dividend to shareholders through a pound(s)1.5bn share buyback .
The Verizon dividend is the second annual payout from the US mobile operator that resumed distributions last year .
However , shares in Vodafone fell almost 3 per cent yesterday to 162.5p after it revealed a pound(s)492m pre-tax loss following a deterioration in many of Europe 's mobile telephony markets .
The company admitted its performance in the first half had been " slightly below our expectations " .
It said business conditions would be similar in the second half .
Service revenues - adjusted for acquisition activity and foreign exchange - fell by 0.4 per cent to pound(s)20.2bn , after a drop of almost 10 per cent in revenues in southern Europe .
On a reported basis , group revenue was down 7.4 per cent to pound(s)21.8bn.
Vodafone has been forced to shoulder impairments of pound(s)5.9bn for Spain and Italy , blaming " challenging market conditions and changes to discount rates " .
The pre-tax loss of pound(s)492m compares with an pound(s)8bn profit last year .
The company reported a basic loss per share of 4.01p.
Adjusted operating profit improved , rising 8.5 per cent to pound(s)6.2bn.
One of the brightest parts of the first-half performance came from the US , where Verizon reported better than expected figures .

Canadian province casts doubt on BHP move
The Canadian province of Saskatchewan is at odds with BHP Billiton over the Australian miner 's $39bn hostile offer for PotashCorp , raising the prospect that the deal might be rejected by the federal government .
A person familiar with the deal said on Tuesday that BHP had offered extra elements valued at about C$370m ( pound(s)228m ) to demonstrate that the deal would be of " net benefit " to Canada , as required under the Investment Canada Act .
However , the province is holding out for more , specifically a one-off levy to go some way to make up for lost tax revenues that would result from the deal .
Brad Wall , the province 's premier , is due to announce his government 's stance on the deal in a speech on Thursday .
Saskatchewan does not have the power to veto BHP 's proposal but its views are likely to be influential in the federal government 's consideration of the deal .
The federal industry department faces a November 3 deadline to determine whether the deal provides a net benefit .
The law allows for another 30 days of negotiation on further commitments .
A consultant 's report commissioned by the province concluded that Saskatchewan could lose at least C$2bn in royalties over the next decade if BHP was allowed to acquire the Saskatoon fertiliser producer .
The revenue loss stems from provincial tax rules that would allow BHP to write off the cost of developing its Jansen Lake potash project against income generated by PotashCorp 's existing operations .
BHP has made several undertakings to assuage public opinion since it unveiled the bid two months ago .
They include locating its global potash headquarters in the province .
Ottawa has rejected only one foreign takeover since the Investment Canada Act took effect in the late 1980s .

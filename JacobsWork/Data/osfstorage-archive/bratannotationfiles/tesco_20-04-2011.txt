Tesco
Chief executives usually come out fighting when they release poor results .
Philip Clarke came out apologising .
We messed up some things , Tesco 's new chief executive as good as said on Tuesday , surprising investors used to his predecessor 's insistence that everything was perfect ( which , in Sir Terry Leahy 's defence , it often was ) .
Mr Clarke 's honesty is refreshing but he need not be too glum .
It is true that the UK business has stagnated .
Underlying sales were flat last year and profit margins declined slightly .
Some of this was self-inflicted : Tesco managed to lose share in electronics , for example , even though consumers are looking to trade down .
Mostly , though , the UK supermarket business is just rough .
The big chains are building more stores even though consumers are spending less .
They will all suffer the consequences .
Tesco at least has an advantage that J Sainsbury , Wm Morrison and Asda do not : it makes about a third of its sales and profits outside the UK .
Success overseas is patchy ( the US business is still bleeding cash ; the Chinese one has not broken even as quickly as Tesco expected ) but overall trading profit rose 11 per cent in Europe and 30 per cent in Asia .
This expansion has been expensive .
Tesco 's return on capital employed is hardly any higher than it was in 2006 .
But Mr Clarke promises a new era of capital discipline and aims to increase ROCE from 12.9 per cent last year to 14.6 per cent by 2015 .
He has linked senior managers ' pay to ROCE improvement , which suggests he means it .
Tesco offers better growth opportunities than peers , yet it is valued at 11 times this year 's earnings , compared with J Sainsbury 's 13 times .
The UK problems notwithstanding , the new leader should not wring his hands too much .

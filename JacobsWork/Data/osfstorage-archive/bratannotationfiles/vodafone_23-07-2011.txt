Vodafone
The task for Vodafone is simple - it just has to do two things at once .
In its first-quarter results on Friday , the UK-based mobile operator confirmed the complete dichotomy it faces in its markets .
On one hand , its emerging markets are racing along .
Revenues in Turkey increased 32 per cent and India were up by 17 per cent ( although intense competition there limits profitability ) .
On the flip side , the mature European business - which contributes about 70 per cent of revenues - barely grew as it nursed revenue falls of 10 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in Greece .
Cautious but confident investors pushed the share price up 2 per cent .
Despite the trouble in Europe , many shareholders are encouraged by the hints that Verizon Wireless , Vodafone 's US joint venture with Verizon , will start paying dividends again next year .
Vodafone generated pound(s)7bn of free cash flow in its last financial year .
Dividends from Verizon Wireless could increase this by 45 per cent , according to analysts Sanford Bernstein .
But this embarrassment of riches could prove a problem .
Vodafone is already underleveraged .
At the end of June , its net debt of pound(s)23bn was only 1.6 times the company 's expected earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation next year .
A pound(s)4bn share buy-back programme now under way will increase that figure to 1.8 times - which would remain about 10 per cent below the company 's target .
Figuring out a use for all the extra cash from the dividends could be a pain .
Vodafone 's own history includes several large acquisitions that proved hard to integrate .
While chief executive Vittorio Colao could merely expand the share buy-back programme , investors might interpret that as a sign that he has run out of ideas .
As with investors in many technology companies , Vodafone shareholders may have to grow used to being heavily invested in cash .

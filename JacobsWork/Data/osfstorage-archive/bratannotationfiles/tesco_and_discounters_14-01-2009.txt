Tesco and discounters
Two things are now clear about UK Christmas sales .
First , they were n't cataclysmic .
The British Retail Consortium laments the worst Christmas since its " retail sales monitor " series began - but that was in 1994 , after the last recession .
This season , like-for-like sales fell 3.3 per cent , but the car industry , for one , would kill for such figures .
Allow for the December value added tax reduction and , Credit Suisse reckons , the underlying decline was 1.8 per cent .
Similarly , the 2.5 per cent gain at Tesco , which has a third of the grocery market , represents a 3.5 per cent rise , VAT-adjusted .
So this was not Tesco 's worst Christmas since the 1990s , but only its worst since last year .
Second , price-led formats are thriving - Aldi , the German-owned discounter , says total UK sales rose 22 per cent in December .
But that does not foreshadow a lasting structural shift .
Aldi is growing fast , but from a puny base and mostly by adding stores .
Its market share increased from 2.6 per cent to 3 per cent in 2008 , good for the year but hardly stunning after a decade and a half in the UK .
The discount segment 's 6 per cent grocery market share has barely changed for years .
That is not to say Tesco is unaffected .
Reduction in selling prices of a couple of percentage points at the retailer in recent months stem in part from its September introduction of " discount brands " , its latest initiative to keep discounters at bay .
The step-up in its Christmas sales from the previous quarter suggests the initiative is paying off - and could start denting the currently superior performance of rival supermarket groups Sainsbury , Wm Morrison , and Wal-Mart 's Asda .
The recession will leave gaps on the high street .
But the established order is not under threat .
The balance of power will stay with the big players , not the price cutters .

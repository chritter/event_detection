Human Genome Sciences sued over GSK ' poison pill '

An investor has sued Human Genome Sciences in an effort to remove a " poison pill " unveiled by the US biotech company to help fend off GlaxoSmithKline's $ 2.6bn hostile bid .

Duane Howells launched a legal action in Maryland after HGSI unveiled measures to boost shares in the event of an unsolicited bid for 15 per cent or more of its capital .

In a legal filing , Mr Howells claimed it was " not a reasonable response " and " will operate to rob the company and its shareholders of the opportunity to obtain a premium change of control transaction " .

He called on the court to suspend the pill pending a rapid hearing , and accused HGSI 's management of " acting to entrench themselves . . . for their own financial interests " . 
HGSI argues that GSK has undervalued the business and has " opportunistically " launched a bid at the time of a one-year low for its stock . 
It claimed substantial potential sales growth for Benlysta , its lupus treatment .

The company said : " We believe this complaint and motion are without merit . "

GSK refused to comment . 
It maintains that its bid at $ 13 a share represents fair value . 
HGSI shares rose 1.25 per cent in New York to $ 13.78 in afternoon trading yesterday .

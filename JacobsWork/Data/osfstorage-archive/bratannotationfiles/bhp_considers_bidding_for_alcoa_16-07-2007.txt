BHP considers bidding for Alcoa
BHP Billiton , the UK-listed miner , has asked Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan to weigh up the merits of it making a bid for Alcoa , the US aluminium group , following rival Rio Tinto 's Dollars 38bn offer for Alcan of Canada .
Rio 's offer is the largest takeover bid seen in the mining sector and is expected to trigger a wave of merger and acquisition activity as rival mining companies try to bulk up and avoid being taken over themselves .
BHP had been interested in making a bid for Alcan but Rio Tinto 's friendly all-cash offer for the aluminium group , worth Dollars 44bn when debt is included , is above what BHP would consider paying .
Attention is now shifting to Alcoa , which made a failed Dollars 27.5bn hostile bid for Alcan in May and is expected to become a take- over target itself .
It is understood that BHP , the world 's largest mining company , has asked Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan to examine whether a bid for Alcoa makes sense .
The two banks are already BHP'sbrokers .
Analysts have said Alcoa is a less attractive target for BHP than Alcan as its aluminium smelters are less efficient and it has lots of downstream assets , such as packaging divisions , that BHP is not interested in .
But Alcoa does have a strong position in the mining and refining of aluminium 's raw materials , bauxite and alumina , which would appeal to BHP .
BHP 's senior executives are thought to be divided about whether to bid for Alcoa .
A person close to the company said that Chip Goodyear , BHP 's outgoing chief executive , would not support a bid unless the deal was a friendly one .
The main issue therefore is whether BHP would be willing to make an offer generous enough to win a recommendation from Alcoa 's board .
This could in part depend on how much BHP thinks it could raise from spinning off Alcoa 's packaging assets .
BHP declined to comment .

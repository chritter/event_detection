Vodafone refocuses executive pay plan
mobile & telecoms ; 25 % of bonuses to be based on ebitda ; Colao 's shares entitlement cut
Vodafone has increased the significance of profit improvement in its pay scheme for senior managers in 2011-12 .
Vodafone 's annual report , published on Wednesday , said managers ' bonuses would take greater account of profit-based targets by reducing the relative importance of revenue-based targets .
The report also disclosed that Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , would only receive 30.6 per cent of the performance shares he was potentially entitled to under a long-term incentive plan .
Vodafone is changing top managers ' remuneration as it seeks to halt the decline in its profit margin at the level of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation .
In 2010-11 , the ebitda margin fell by 1.1 percentage points to 32 per cent .
Last year , Vodafone made taking revenue market share from rivals a key part of top managers ' cash bonuses , as the group tried to end weak performances by some of its European businesses .
Vodafone 's remuneration committee decided that 30 per cent of bonuses in 2010-11 would be based on revenue growth , with 20 per cent tied to increasing operating profit .
The rest of the bonuses were based on free cash flow and a comparison with rivals ' performances .
In May , Mr Colao claimed Vodafone was increasing or maintaining its revenue market share in most key countries .
Fourth-quarter results for 2010-11 showed solid revenue performances at Vodafone 's UK and German businesses .
Vodafone 's remuneration committee has decided that in 2011-12 , 25 per cent of bonuses will be based on increasing ebitda , with 25 per cent tied to revenue growth .
" To emphasise our focus on profitable growth we have rebalanced the weightings for . . . revenue and profit so the two measures are equally weighted , " said the annual report .
Mr Colao 's basic pay and perks , including his bonus , increased by 2.5 per cent to pound(s)2.7m in 2010-11 .
At pound(s)1.3m , however , his bonus fell short of the maximum potential pay-out of pound(s)2m .
In addition to his basic pay and perks , Mr Colao will see 2.1m performance shares vest in July under the group 's long term incentive plan .
Mr Colao was awarded 7.1m shares under the scheme in 2008 , but only 2.1m will vest based on Vodafone 's operational performance over the three years to 2010-11 .
The 2.1m shares represent 30.6 per cent of his maximum entitlement , and are worth pound(s)3.5m based on Wednesday 's closing price of 161.55p.
At March 31 , Mr Colao had been awarded 20.6m shares under the long-term incentive plan , worth pound(s)36.3m.
However , the shares are all subject to performance conditions .
Mr Colao 's salary will increase by 6.4 per cent to pound(s)1.1m in 2011-12 .
Gerard Kleisterlee , the former chief executive of Philips who is due to become Vodafone 's chairman at the July annual meeting , will receive a salary of pound(s)600,000 .
Sir John Bond , Vodafone 's outgoing chairman , had a salary of pound(s)600,000 in 2010-11 .

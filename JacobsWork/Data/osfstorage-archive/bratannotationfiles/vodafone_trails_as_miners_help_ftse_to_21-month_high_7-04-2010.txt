Vodafone trails as miners help FTSE to 21-month high
LONDON
Vodafone lagged behind a buoyant London market yesterday after the group 's US joint venture partner played down merger hopes .
The shares slid 1.4 per cent to 149 1/2 p after Verizon 's chief executive Ivan Seidenberg said a merger did not " seem to have a lot of appeal " .
Last week Vodafone had added 3.4 per cent on news that it was in discussions over the future of its Verizon Wireless venture , which does not currently pay a dividend .
Mr Seidenberg told reporters that , while Verizon would like to find a way to " resolve " Vodafone 's minority stake in the venture , a union was not on the agenda .
" This notion of a global wireless-only carrier is no longer the preferred model , " he said .
Energy companies and miners led the wider market , which played catch-up after the release of US jobs and manufacturing data over the Easter holiday .
The FTSE 100 rose to its highest since June 2008 , up 35.46 points , or 0.6 per cent , to 5,780.34.
Oil majors provided 20 points of the Footsie 's gain as crude reached an 18-month high .
BP climbed 2.4 per cent to 646 1/4 p , and the B shares of Royal Dutch Shell added 1.7 per cent to pound(s)18.60.
Tullow Oil rose 2.4 per cent to pound(s)13.13 following a report that Korea National Oil Company was interested in buying a stake in its Jubilee field in Ghana .
ENRC led the miners , up 3.4 per cent to pound(s)12.66.
That followed European steelmakers agreeing a 35 per cent increase in ferrochrome pricing for the second quarter against the first , which was higher than analysts had expected .
Rio Tinto gained 1.4 per cent to pound(s)40.62 amid speculation that its proposed iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton could fail amid growing regulatory hostility .
The recent surge in ore prices has also led some Rio shareholders to argue that the deal terms have moved too far in favour of BHP , up 1.3 per cent to pound(s)23.31.
Elsewhere among the risers , Arm Holdings took on 2.2 per cent to 246 1/4 p following Apple 's iPad launch .
RBS spotted seven Arm designs in the iPad , suggesting the chip company will earn royalties of 45 cents per unit or 35 cents for the wi-fi version .
British Airways led the blue-chip fallers , down 2.3 per cent to 243 1/4 p , on the rising oil price and uncertainty about its Iberia merger , which was due to be signed off at the end of March .
BAE Systems faded 1.3 per cent to 368 3/4 p in spite of news from the prime minister 's office that Oman intends to buy as many as 24 Eurofighter aircraft from the UK .
Such an order may be worth up to pound(s)2bn to BAE , or as much as 15p per share , JPMorgan Cazenove estimated .
But Goldman Sachs , repeating long-standing " sell " advice on BAE shares , worried that Oman 's supply could be diverted from the UK 's planned purchase .
Following a strong run last week , Petrofac closed down 1.6 per cent at pound(s)12.65 adjusting for its spin-off of EnQuest .
The North Sea oil producer finished its maiden day 's trading at 103 3/4 p , up 6 per cent from its initial price .
Among the midcaps , Connaught bounced 5.6 per cent to 267 3/4 p after settling a dispute over a contract with Norwich City Council .
The group , which also said its trading was in line with expectations , has lost about a third of its value this year after the exit of its chief executive .
" There is likely to be a concerted effort to address the market 's concerns with the interims on April 27 , " said Oriel Securities .
Hargreaves Lansdown gained 5.2 per cent to 347p after Numis raised forecasts and repeated " buy " advice in an otherwise cautious review of the wealth manager .
Hargreaves 's valuation of 18 times earnings , compared with a sector average of 15 times , is " more than justified by its high-quality recurring income and superior growth profile " , it said .
Qinetiq , the troubled defence-research contractor , edged up 0.1 per cent to 136p amid speculation it could spin off its US division to help ease pressures on cash .
UBS last month said the cost of the redundancy programme Qinetiq required would push it close to banking covenants .

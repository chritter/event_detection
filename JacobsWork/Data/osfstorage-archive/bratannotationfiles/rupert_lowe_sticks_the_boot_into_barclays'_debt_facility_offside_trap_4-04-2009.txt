Rupert Lowe sticks the boot into Barclays ' debt facility offside trap
Rupert Lowe has come through many a scrap with foes in his long association with Southampton football club , writes Roger Blitz .
His latest tussle with Barclays , with which the club had an overdraft facility , left him spitting mad and savage in his criticism of the bank 's behaviour .
Barclays was " constantly trying to lends us money throughout my tenure , " said Mr Lowe , who resigned as chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings , the club 's parent company , on Thursday .
At the end of his previous role as chairman , in July 2006 , SLH had a small surplus .
He returned last May with SLH overdrawn by pound(s)1.3m on a facility of pound(s)5m .
" The bank was a salesman rather than a lender for a long period of time , " said Mr Lowe , who is also chairman of broker WH Ireland and was formerly at Deutsche Bank .
Mr Lowe said he set about cutting costs to bring the debt back into the facility , only to discover the bank deciding in November to cut the facility back to pound(s)4m .
The crunch appears to have been the January transfer window .
Hopes of player sales did not materialise and the club 's precarious position - next to bottom in the Championship - contributed to the bank 's loss of confidence .
Barclays said the company 's " reasonable " goals of raising significantly club attendance , player sales , a general increase in income and the need to raise further investment had " not been met " , and that it would work with all parties to achieve them .
Mr Lowe will not be among them .
" The directors did n't have sufficient amount of money to refinance the club personally " , he said .
" I have never pretender to be a member of the uber-rich . "

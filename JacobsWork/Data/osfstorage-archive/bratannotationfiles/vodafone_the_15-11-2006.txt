Vodafone THE
Arun Sarin was widely predicted to walk the plank , but Vodafone 's chief executive is the last man standing .
Of the chairman , deputy and executive directors serving in March 2005 , six of the seven will have left by December .
Strategic decisions made during this period have proved astute .
A fifth of the then market capitalisation , or Pounds 21bn , has been returned to shareholders .
Vodafone Japan was sold for an excellent price , given its subsequent woes under Softbank .
And Vodafone resisted hysterical calls to sell its Verizon wireless stake , the value of which has soared .
First half results showed some revival at the operating level .
The tax rate will now be in the low , rather than mid thirties , boosting earnings by about 5 per cent .
The value of this roughly offsets the Pounds 5bn tax hit that so incensed investors last November .
Adjusting for an accounting change , organic proportionate mobile sales growth was at the top end of guidance of 6-6.5 per cent .
Margins were stable .
Execution has improved .
The big picture has not .
Just over half of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation came from ex-growth Europe where price elasticity remains poor .
Still , this is now priced in .
Few eyebrows were raised at the Pounds 4.3bn impairment charge in Germany , nor at the footnote explaining that this assumed 5 per cent annual ebitda declines until 2011 .
The remaining ebitda is split between the US , growing at 21 per cent , and mainly emerging markets growing at 12 per cent .
Vodafone will hold an investor day to highlight the latter on December 6 .
Mr Sarin was keen to point out that the Pounds 2.6bn acquisition of Turkey 's Telsim is outperforming its budget .
Chairman Sir John Bond used his first public outing to highlight growth beyond Europe .
It may not be original or even well-timed , but along with improved execution , this new sense of direction should mark the close of Vodafone 's annus horribilis .

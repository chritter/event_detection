Tesco in demand as its foreign division looks set to prosper
Tesco was in demand after its recently appointed house broker said shares in the retailer could rise 70 per cent over the next five years as investors come to appreciate the potential of its international division .
In a 136-page research report , Lehman Brothers , which replaced Merrill Lynch as broker in March , said the growth of Tesco 's Asian and European operations would drive the company 's share price toward 734p by 2011-12 .
" On our recent visit to South Korea , Thailand and China - which industry analysts last saw in 2004 - we examined the business first hand and the significant potential that these countries possess to enhance Tesco 's value in the next five years , " analyst Matthew Truman said , as he upgraded to " overweight " .
In 2012 , Mr Truman expects Tesco 's overseas division to generate sales of Pounds 24bn and earnings before interest and tax of Pounds 1.23bn.
To put that figure in context , J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison combined are expected to generate underlying earnings of just more than Pounds 1bn in 2008 .
Tesco shares closed 4.4 per cent higher at 433 1/2p , while Sainsbury climbed 2.4 per cent at 557p amid talk that the board of the food retailer was poised to allow Delta Two , the investment vehicle backed by the State of Qatar , access to its books .
Delta has said it is prepared to bid 600p a share for Sainsbury .
Morrison added 2.8 per cent to 280 1/2p after Deutsche Bank increased its target price to 335p ahead of next Thursday 's half- year figures .
Analyst James Collins said : " We expect a strong showing and believe that the risk of consensus forecast upgrades is high " .
In the wider market , leading shares snapped back from a two session losing run in spectacular style .
Lifted by an overnight rally on Wall Street and further gains at the opening , the FTSE 100 surged 146.6 points , or 2.4 per cent , to 6,280.7 with the heavyweight banking sector leading the way on a mixture of short covering and bargain hunting .
Barclays gained 4.7 per cent to 607 1/2p , while Northern Rock rallied 4 per cent to 672p and HBOS added3.2 per cent to 899p .
Before yesterday 's rally , the FTSE banking index had fallen 7.3 per cent and had underperformed the wider market by 7.7 per cent since the start of August .
The FTSE 250 climbed 237.5 points , or 2.2 per cent , to 11,212.3.
Market turnover remained below average with 2.6bn shares traded .
Just two blue chip stocks ended in negative territory .
One was Rentokil Initial which eased 0.5 per cent to 170.9p on a flurry of profit taking and the other was DSG International , the parent company of Currys and PC World .
Its shares fell 0.2 per cent to 146.9p after a very bearish note from Morgan Stanley .
In it analyst Geoff Ruddell downgraded to " underweight " , cut his target price to 135p and said DSG 's dividend was unsustainable and could be cut by its new chief executive next summer .
He wrote : " We expect DSGI 's new CEO to set out his strategy for the business at some point during the second quarter of 2008 .
We think it will be more radical than the market currently anticipates and believe it is very likely to include a cut in the dividend . "
Elsewhere , Man Group , the hedge fund manager , was marked 3.4 per cent higher at 486 1/2p after a positive presentation at Citigroup on Monday night .
Among the mid caps , housebuilder Taylor Wimpey improved 1.4 per cent to 333 1/4p , while Tullow Oil added 1 per cent to 555 1/2p , and Carphone Warehouse rose 3.6 per cent to 340 1/2p .
Based on last night 's closing prices the three companies are likely to be promoted to the FTSE 100 at today 's quarterly review , replacing Drax Group , up 0.9 per cent to 627p , Segro , 2.3 per cent higher at 511p and Kelda , up 2 per cent at 869p .
FKI , the engineering company that ended takeover discussions with a private equity group a month ago , remained under pressure .
Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to 95p after Merrill Lynch downgraded to " sell " and said FKI might have trouble executing its strategic plan and paying down debt .
Sports Direct International fell 4.6 per cent to a record low of 131p after rival JJB Sports , down 14.2 per cent to 172 1/4p , issued a profits warning .

Tesco shares regain poise after earnings report
An hour after reporting a collapse in European earnings on Wednesday , Tesco shares had lost nearly 5 per cent .
From then to the close of play yesterday , they had climbed nearly 7 percentage points , writes Bryce Elder .
Two lines of thought had powered the recovery , said analysts .
First , the weak headline figures had disguised signs of stabilisation , particularly in the UK .
Second , with Tesco valued at 20 per cent below the long-term average at only 13 times 2014 earnings , investors were already pricing in further disappointments .
" For a diverse company like Tesco , all rarely goes well at the same time , " said Credit Suisse .
" We think Tesco is doing the right things in key areas to secure sustained improvement . "
Tesco ended the session up 2 per cent at 365p , outperforming a slow wider market .
The FTSE 100 edged up 11.54 points at 6,449.04 , a 0.2 per cent gain .
A profit warning from William Hill suggested that investors were anticipating bad news more accurately than analysts .
The bookmaker 's alert of a pound(s)20m hit to quarterly earnings , largely from unfavourable football results , lifted its stock 0.4 per cent to 413p .
BP was up 1.1 per cent to 437.2p after successfully appealing to overturn a US claims process that would have forced it to pay out bogus compensation claims for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Aviva rose 1.4 per cent to 413.1p after completing the disposal of its US life operations for pound(s)1.7bn , pound(s)500m more than agreed in December .
Talk of potential acquisitions by Reckitt Benckiser , down 0.3 per cent to pound(s)43.90 , were given another airing .
Morgan Stanley forecast Reckitt could spend between pound(s)4bn and pound(s)5bn to expand its consumer health division .
WPP drifted 0.1 per cent to pound(s)12.57.
The group is reported to have told Citi that growth has not been quite as strong as the 5 per cent flagged in August .
It played down fears that emerging markets had deteriorated further , and dismissed the idea that WPP might react to the Publicis-Omnicom merger with its own mega deal .
Aggreko , the power generator specialist , remained out of favour , down 1.9 per cent to pound(s)14.79.

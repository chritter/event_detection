BASF THE
Chemical companies are in a cyclical sweet spot at the moment , and none more so than BASF , the largest and most efficient of the commodity producers .
The strongest global economic upturn for years has boosted volumes and utilisation rates , while a lack of new capacity has allowed the sector to regain genuine pricing power .
The German group 's third-quarter results show just how powerful a combination this can be .
Volumes jumped 14 per cent , with growth across all units and regions .
Prices , up 10 per cent at group level and by 22 per cent at the plastics arm , increased ahead of raw material costs - helped by the fact that BASF 's oil division , which provides half the group 's crude feedstock , serves as a natural hedge against rising oil prices .
It is no wonder quarterly operating profits more than doubled to Euros 1bn on a one-fifth gain in revenues , beating all forecasts .
No cycle lasts for ever , but analysts expect almost two more good years until chemical demand peaks in mid-2006 and even BASF will admit to one .
Meanwhile , it expects to exceed its cost of capital ( which it puts at a very high 10 per cent ) this year , which should prompt a dividend increase and even more share buybacks .
The stock has nicely outperformed over the past year , but , at around five times next year 's earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation still suffers from a lower rating than rivals such as Dow Chemical and DuPont .
That seems unduly niggardly .

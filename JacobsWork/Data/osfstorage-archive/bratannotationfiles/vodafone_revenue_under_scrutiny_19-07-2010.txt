Vodafone revenue under scrutiny
Vodafone issues a first-quarter trading update on Friday , and analysts will be looking for signs that the mobile phone operator is on course to resume revenue growth , writes Andrew Parker .
The company said in May that it expected to return to " low levels " of organic revenue growth in 2010-11 , although it stressed it would be dependent on the economic environment , including employment levels .
Citigroup analysts expect Vodafone to report a 0.2 per cent underlying decline in service revenue paid by mobile phone users for the three months to June 30 compared with the same period last year .
They say such a performance will enable management " to reiterate its target of achieving positive growth at the group level during the course of this fiscal year " .
The Citi analysts estimate Vodafone will report pound(s)11.1bn of revenue for its first quarter , up 3 per cent on the same period last year , partly due to favourable exchange rate movements .

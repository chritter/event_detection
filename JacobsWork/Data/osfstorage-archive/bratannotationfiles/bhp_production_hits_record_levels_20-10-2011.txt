BHP production hits record levels
BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining company by market capitalisation , has joined rival Rio Tinto in boosting quarterly production of iron ore to record levels , lifting output of the mineral used in steelmaking by almost a quarter .
Improvements to its rail infrastructure in Australia helped BHP largely meet market expectations with a 24 per cent year-on-year rise in production of the commodity , the biggest contributor to group profit , to 39.6m tonnes .
The jump comes even as benchmark iron ore prices come under pressure on fears about weakening demand from China , the world 's biggest iron ore consumer , whose economy is growing at the slowest pace in two years .
Spot iron ore hit a fresh low for the year this week of $150 a tonne .
However , BHP 's production of base metals fell .
Copper output dashed expectations with a 24 per cent drop .

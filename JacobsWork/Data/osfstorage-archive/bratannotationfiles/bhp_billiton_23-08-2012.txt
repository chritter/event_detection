BHP Billiton
When BHP Billiton pauses to rethink expansion of its $20bn Olympic Dam copper and uranium project in South Australia , it is a sign that this commodities cycle is fizzling out .
The diversified miner is no more immune than its peers to falling commodities demand and prices , or rising costs .
At least it has the discipline to know when to halt capital expenditure : half way into early engineering work on the project , the capital costs were rising too fast .
Factor in local cost inflation and poor productivity and it should be no surprise that BHP has more attractive spending options .
A $342m after-tax impairment on Olympic Dam and other projects , also announced yesterday , is on top of $1.8bn on its US shale gas assets and $355m on nickel assets in Australia .
These exceptionals shrank BHP 's June full-year net profit more than a third from 2011 to $15.4bn - the same level as five years ago in nominal terms , despite revenue up a fifth since 2008 to a record $72bn .
If The Big Australian 's results represent a new normal for the mining industry , what should chief executive Marius Kloppers be doing to adapt ?
For a start , he must cut costs hard to protect margins .
He can not control price , but knows that it will be partly driven by the pace of supply response .
That suggests allocating capex only to projects for commodities likely to be in demand in the next decade , for which supply lags behind demand .
Mr Kloppers should also watch gearing , which crept up to 26 per cent with its Petrohawk Energy acquisition .
BHP has more options than most .
Yet , trading on 9.5 times forward earnings - a discount to Anglo American and Xstrata - it has no credit for its diverse portfolio or for its outperformance of its index since the crisis .
Investors who sense a commodities slide beyond China 's managed slowdown have a point .
Mr Kloppers must show his mettle now : impairments hurt ; rising profits heal .

Barclays
Barclays Capital 's strength is as a debt house .
Yet the investment bank 's fixed income , commodities and currencies unit has delivered a lacklustre performance in the first quarter .
Revenue fell by more than a fifth from a year ago to pound(s)2.1bn.
Its equity business , comprising the former northern American operations of Lehman Brothers , also disappointed , achieving only an 11 per cent increase in revenue for a business that must bear heavy hiring costs .
Overall , BarCap 's revenue fell 15 per cent from a year ago .
Investors , spooked both by the outlook for the business that delivers the bulk of Barclays ' profits and by doubts over the group 's ability to increase return on equity , marked down the shares by 4.2 per cent .
Bob Diamond , chief executive , acknowledged their concern in February when he cut Barclays ' return on equity target to 13 per cent by 2013 .
Given the 8.1 per cent achieved in the normally strong first quarter , that looks like a stretch .
But he has made a start : costs were flat , BarCap cut credit market exposures and Barclays sold property .
The bank will also restructure its loan to the Protium Finance vehicle into which it tipped $12.3bn of illiquid loans in 2009 , a conjuring trick that was supposed to tune out mark-to-market earnings volatility .
Conditions have improved since .
But the real reason for that deal is that looming Basel III reforms would force Barclays to hold more capital against its Protium loan .
It now hopes to boost overall returns by taking back ownership of the assets and running them off pronto .
With Protium , Barclays has reminded investors that it is , in effect , just another UK bank restructuring play .
Given the uncertain outlook for BarCap and pressure to meet higher regulatory capital requirements , the current share price , at 0.84 times book value , looks about right .

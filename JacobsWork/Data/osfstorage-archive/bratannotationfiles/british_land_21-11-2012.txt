British Land
The cranes stare at each other across the City of London from the top of skyscrapers that they seem to be pulling out of the ground .
On one side is British Land 's Cheesegrater , one-third pre-let , largely to US insurance group Aon .
On the other is Land Securities ' Walkie Talkie , a quarter pre-let to a collection of other insurers .
It is not only a passion for glitzy developments that unites companies .
They also offer very similar investment propositions , with pound(s)10bn portfolios focused on UK retail and London offices .
Land Securities enjoys the higher rating .
Its shares trade at a 10 per cent discount to forecast net asset value , against 13 per cent for British Land .
That partly reflects the latter 's higher debt - 46 per cent of its portfolio is financed by debt , against 36 per cent for Land Securities .
Although interest payments are comfortably covered by income , the debt-inspired property crash of 2008 still casts a shadow over the sector .
But first-half results from both during the past two weeks suggest there is reason for a more generous stance towards British Land .
First its retail portfolio , which accounts for 60 per cent of the total , is performing slightly better than its rival 's .
In tough conditions , it limited the decline in value to 1 per cent over the half , against a fall of almost 3 per cent at Land Securities .
And it has been shifting the balance of its office portfolio , with the West End ( where rents are higher ) now accounting for a half .
British Land has also been taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance debt , recently completing a convertible issue at a coupon of just 1.5 per cent .
The result is that its cost of debt is 4.4 per cent , which is 70 basis points below Land Securities ' .
Add that to the valuation discount and a dividend yield that , at 5.1 per cent , will attract income investors , and British Land looks the more attractive of the two .

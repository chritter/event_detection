Colao 's pay at Vodafone doubles to £ 14m


Vittorio Colao 's total pay this year as chief executive of Vodafone will more than double to about £ 14m , including salary , bonuses and share options , thanks to long-term outperformance against the mobile operators ' peers .

Mr Colao 's total remuneration includes a leap in long-term bonus , as Vodafone exceeded targets for adjusted free cash flow and total shareholder return in comparison with rivals such as BT , France Telecom and Telefónica .

According to Vodafone 's annual report , published on Friday , the total value of the shares awarded to Mr Colao under the company 's long-term incentive scheme almost tripled from £ 3.75m to £ 10.99m .

This was somewhat counterbalanced by a drop in Mr Colao 's annual bonus from £ 1.3m last year to £ 1m . 
In May , Vodafone announced a 1.3 per cent rise in revenues to £ 46.4bn for the 12 months to March 31 , while pre-tax profit was flat at £ 9.5bn , with a £ 4bn impairment charge for poor performance in rapidly weakening European markets .

Mr Colao has agreed to retain his share award in stock for a further two years , after cashing in a portion to settle tax obligations , taking his total shareholding to more than ten times his base salary , which rose 5 per cent to £ 1.1m .

Shareholders have targeted a series of British companies over what they regarded as excessive executive pay in recent months , although Vodafone notes that last year its shareholders voted 96.12 per cent in favour of the company 's remuneration report .

Between July 2008 , when Mr Colao became chief executive , and March 2012 , Vodafone delivered total shareholder return of 45.8 per cent , a £ 14.9bn appreciation in market capitalisation , with £ 19.2bn paid out in dividends and £ 6.7bn in share buybacks .

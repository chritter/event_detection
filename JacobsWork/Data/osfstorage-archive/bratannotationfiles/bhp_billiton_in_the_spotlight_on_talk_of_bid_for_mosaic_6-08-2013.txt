BHP Billiton in the spotlight on talk of bid for Mosaic
BHP Billiton was a talking point in a lacklustre London market amid deal speculation .
Merrill Lynch argued BHP should make an opportunistic bid for Mosaic , North American 's second-largest potash producer .
Buying Mosaic for about $20bn made more sense than BHP 's current plan to bring its own Jansen potash project into production at a potential cost of up to $15bn , the broker said .
Having had a $39bn bid for Canada 's PotashCorp blocked in 2010 , BHP remains committed to building a world-scale potash business , Merrill said .
BHP ended up 0.4 per cent to pound(s)19.02 , slightly outperforming a tepid wider market .
The FTSE 100 ended 0.4 per cent lower , losing 28.29 points to 6,619.58.
HSBC alone took 24 points off the FTSE after its half-year earnings missed market expectations .
The stock lost 4.4 per cent to 721.7p , while Standard Chartered was down 1.3 per cent to pound(s)15.24.
Royal Bank of Scotland faded 1.6 per cent to 317.4p with SocGen adding the stock to its " sell " list .
Its analysts reckoned RBS needed to set aside a further pound(s)1bn for bad debts .
" RBS 's non-performing loans remain within 1 per cent of their peak , while those at Lloyds and Barclays are down 39 per cent and 25 per cent , respectively , " said SocGen .
" We wonder if the new CEO and finance director may be tempted to top up provisioning here , perhaps as a compromise for the government not pursuing a bad bank structure . "
Lloyds Banking Group led the blue-chip risers , up 2.7 per cent to 75.7p , after chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio told investors that Lloyds targeted paying out up to 70 per cent of earnings in dividends within three years .
Merrill Lynch called the 70 per cent target " plausible " , though awaiting regulatory clarity it forecast a much lower payout .
Potential earnings in 2015 of 8.6p a share would suggest a dividend of up to 5.8p , it noted .
Drax rose 2.9 per cent to 672.5p after Goldman Sachs upgraded to " buy " with a 900p target price .
By the middle of 2014 , the power station owner will have switched two of its coal-fired plants to biomass with a further two conversions expected before 2017 , Goldman said .
The transformation meant Drax could deliver 40 per cent earnings a share growth annually over the next five years , which more than justified the valuation of 29 times current-year earnings , it said .
Thomas Cook climbed 5.5 per cent to 169.9p on an upgrade to " buy " from Citigroup .
" Although we remain sceptical over long-term revenue growth in the sector , we now expect full delivery of cost savings to drive material upgrades to earnings , " said Citi .

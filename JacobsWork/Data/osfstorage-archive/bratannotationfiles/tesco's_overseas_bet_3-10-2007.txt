Tesco 's overseas bet
Though brutal weather in June and July scared off shoppers , Sir Terry Leahy , Tesco 's chief executive , was resolutely upbeat about the future as the retailer reported underlying first-half trading profits of Pounds 1.2bn , a 10 per cent rise year on year .
Is his unusually jolly tone justified ?
Like-for-like sales in the UK , excluding fuel , grew 3.5 per cent , one of the lowest figures in years .
Tesco executives took pains to blame the results on the lousy summer weather , including a comparison of hours of sunshine and same-store sales in their analyst presentation .
There is evidence to support this claim .
Rival Morrisons ' same-store summer sales were also unimpressive , up just 2.7 per cent year on year , and Tesco 's like-for-like sales improved in August along with the weather .
Non-food sales , though small , grew faster .
Although its dominance in the UK remains unchallenged , Tesco 's growth prospects lie abroad .
International sales grew 22 per cent in the first half year on year and accounted for just one-quarter of Pounds 25bn total group sales .
The figures include China for the first time ; Tesco now owns 90 per cent of its venture there .
Four- fifths of the group 's new space this year will open outside the UK .
Next month , Tesco opens its first US stores in California and the south-west .
The specially designed Fresh & Easy chain seems to be positioning itself as the opposite of Wal-Mart .
It emphasises healthy food , convenience and fitting into neighbourhoods .
It also offers health insurance to employees .
So far the US investment is tiny , but Tesco usually seeks to be a top player in the markets where it operates .
The weak dollar could also make a US acquisition relatively cheap .
The US economy may be teetering on the edge of recession but Tesco insists that it can make headway relative to rivals .
Sir Terry predicts half of group sales will come from outside the UK within a decade .
His legacy depends on it .

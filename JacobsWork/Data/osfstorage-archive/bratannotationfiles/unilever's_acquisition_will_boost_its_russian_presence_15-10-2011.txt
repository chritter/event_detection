Unilever 's acquisition will boost its Russian presence
Consumer products
Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group , is beefing up its Russian portfolio with the acquisition of Concern Kalina in a deal that values the beauty company 's equity at EUR500m .
The maker of Dove shampoo and Flora margarine will pay EUR390m for an 82 per cent stake in Kalina , subject to regulatory approval , before launching a mandatory tender offer to buy the remaining shares .
The deal is the latest in the consumer sector to tap into the Russian market , which is robust by European standards , albeit less so than the other big emerging markets .
Late last year PepsiCo unveiled a $5.4bn bet on the Russian food and drinks market through the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann , the dairy and fruit juice company .
At the same time Danone of France acquired Russia 's Unimilk .
Unilever itself acquired Inmarko ice cream company in 2008 .
Unilever , which derives more than half its sales from emerging markets , has a weaker position in Russia than in Brazil and India .
Announcing the deal , Paul Polman , chief executive , said the deal would " transform " its personal care business in Russia .
" This [ gives ] us leading positions in skin care and hair care , as well as establishing a presence in oral care , " he said .
" It will also strengthen and rebalance Unilever 's portfolio and competitive position in Russia , an emerging market with considerable potential and one of our priority countries . "
Concern Kalina , Russia 's biggest local personal care company by sales , is expected to generate sales of EUR303m this year .

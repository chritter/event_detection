BASF to study shale gas potential in Germany
chemicals
BASF said it wanted to research the potential for shale gas production in Germany and warned politicians not to endanger the competitiveness of Europe 's industry by adding to its already high energy costs .
BASF would like to explore the possibility for " fracking " in Germany but must overcome widespread environmental concerns about the use of this technique in a densely populated country .
Fracking involves the pumping of water and chemicals at high pressure into rocks to release stores of gas .
" We must ensure that [ fracking ] does n't become the next subject of angst , " said Kurt Bock , BASF chief executive .
Germany 's economy and environment ministries agreed draft legislation yesterday that could one day pave the way for fracking in Germany .
BASF is in favour of a legal framework for fracking in Germany and Mr Bock described the government decision as " important " and said he hoped it would lead to a more objective discussion .
EU politicians are pressing for changes to the EU emissions trading scheme as the market price of carbon credits has fallen to a low level .
But BASF remains opposed to such intervention .
BASF said revenues and earnings would rise in 2013 due to recovery in demand and efficiency measures .
Full-year sales rose 7 per cent to EUR78.7bn but net income declined 21 per cent to EUR4.9bn as the higher proportion of earnings from oil and gas boosted its tax bill .
A dividend of EUR2.60 , up 10 cents , was proposed .

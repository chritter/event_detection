Barclays
Let 's split Barclays into two .
Into one bucket , put all of the corporate colour of the past couple of years - the Libor fine , the insurance mis-selling claims , the interest rate swap mis-selling claims , Bob Diamond 's departure , the pound(s)5.8bn rights issue , etc.
Into the other put the actual operations , the humdrum business of taking deposits , lending and dealing in the financial markets .
Over the past two years , the share price suggests that the two have cancelled each other out .
At 274p , the shares are no higher than they were in mid-2011 despite the prospect of economic recovery .
Yesterday 's third-quarter numbers show growth slowly coming through .
Profits in UK retail banking were 18 per cent ahead of the average for the past eight quarters .
Africa , Barclaycard and corporate banking also did better than the long-term average .
Even the problematic European business managed to post a smaller loss than it usually does .
The problem business in the third quarter was the investment bank , dragged back by a slowdown in fixed income trading .
Profits from the division were pound(s)463m , 45 per cent below the average quarterly level over the past two years .
If the shares are to push on from their rating of 0.9 times tangible book value , Barclays has to do two things .
First , consign bucket one to history .
Chief executive Antony Jenkins ' focus on ethics bodes well .
But yesterday the bank said it was reviewing its foreign exchange business in the light of regulatory interest , so there is still potential for nasties lurking at the bottom .
The second is to stop the investment bank from overshadowing recovery elsewhere .
There should be news on that next year as Barclays reveals more detail on plans to shrink its balance sheet .
Volatile , capital-intensive businesses such as fixed-income trading are likely to be in the line of fire .

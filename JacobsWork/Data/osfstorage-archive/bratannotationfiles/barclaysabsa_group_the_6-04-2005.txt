Barclays / Absa Group THE
When Barclays decided to scale back in South Africa in 1986 , political considerations loomed large .
They still do , although in a different way , now that it is close to making an offer for a majority stake in Absa Group , South Africa 's largest retail bank .
But at least the business case is sound .
A deal with Absa makes sense for several reasons .
First , Absa is well-established in a banking market where falling interest rates have fuelled growth but the average household debt ratio remains less than half that of the UK .
Second , Barclays ' existing wholesale operation in South Africa complements Absa 's retail focus .
Finally , Barclays ' discount to its global peers means it has to pay with cash .
With Absa trading on a one-year forward price / earnings multiple of 8.5 compared with Barclays ' 9.9 , it offers growth and strategic fit without dilution .
On current estimates , the deal is still accretive if Barclays pays a 10 per cent premium to the current R77 a share - already up 27 per cent since last September 's announcement .
Sceptics counter that Absa is cheap for good reasons : namely , political and currency risk .
But with Absa representing less than 10 per cent of earnings in a consolidated group , such risk looks manageable .
Forecast earnings growth for Absa of 12 per cent a year to 2008 - before any synergies - should cushion rand movements .
Much now rests on the government 's as-yet-undisclosed conditions .
Barclays is right to take its time mulling them over , but the logic is there .

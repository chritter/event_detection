Delhaize shrugs off Unilever clash
Delhaize , the Belgian supermarket group that operates the Food Lion chain in the US , yesterday rebuffed suggestions that a spat with Unilever had damaged its prospects as it unveiled 2008 results that were ahead of market expectations , writes Stanley Pignal in Brussels .
Delhaizelast week resolved a month-long dispute with the supplier of brands such as Knorr , Dove and Lynx , which caused Unilever to pull most of its range from Delhaize 's 775 Belgian stores .
Pierre-Olivier Beckers , Delhaize 's chief executive , dismissed a marketing agency study that the clash had hurt first-quarter sales .
Unilever had taken out a series of ads in the Belgian press , encouraging shoppers to seek its products in rival supermarkets .
Delhaize had previously advertised its own labels as alternatives to Unilever products .
Andrew Wood , analyst at Bernstein Research , said the spat , which led Delhaize shoppers to go elsewhere , highlights " the strength of the manufacturers and the brand loyalty that can overshadow retailer pressures " .
The dispute was followed through the retail world as a gauge of how the relationship between suppliers and supermarkets would evolve during the economic downturn .
Delhaize is aiming to add between 70 and 80 stores to bring its total to about 2,750 worldwide , 1,600 of which will be in the US .
Exposure to the US dollar helped boost fourth-quarter net profit , which rose 30.5 per cent to EUR163.4m.
An annual dividend of EUR1.48 a share was proposed on earnings per share of EUR4.70.

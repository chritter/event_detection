Barclays drops 24 % on fresh concerns about writedowns
LONDON
Barclays slumped by 24 per cent yesterday on fresh concerns about its balance sheet strength .
The stock tumbled after Panmure Gordon analyst Sandy Chen said credit writedowns might be about double the company 's current estimate .
" We expect Barclays will record major losses in 2009 and 2010 , " he said .
" If corporate defaults jump and structured credits undergo another wave of downgrades , we think that the structure of swaps with monolines and other counterparties that Barclays put in place to limit losses could buckle . "
In its 2008 results , Barclays revealed net derivatives exposures had risen by pound(s)30bn , with about pound(s)21bn of swap contracts in place with monoline insurers .
According to Mr Chen , such deals put Barclays at risk of " double defaults " , whereby the underlying assets default and counterparties including the monolines fail to honour their insurance commitment .
He forecast Barclays to write down its credit portfolio by pound(s)13bn in 2009 and 2010 .
The company currently targets pound(s)7bn-pound(s)8bn .
Shares in Barclays dropped 24.1 per cent to 65 1/2 p.
The stock was also affected by news that US liquidators of Lehman Brothers had asked it to account for an estimated $3.3bn Lehman had earmarked for bonuses and other liabilities .
Barclays bought Lehman 's north American operations last year .
The FTSE 100 dropped 3.2 per cent , down 116.01 points to 3,529.86.
That all but erased the previous day 's rally from six-year lows .
Aviva led the insurers into a tailspin after its 2008 earnings report suggested a weaker balance sheet than investors had expected .
Higher default assumptions , asbestos reserving and other unrealised losses pushed net tangible asset value well below forecasts .
" In a sector where support lines appear to be based around these metrics [ irrespective of earnings ] , Aviva simply looks too high in comparison with sector peers , " said Deutsche Bank , which cut the stock from its " buy " list .
Other devils in the detail included a commercial real estate book that was 65 per cent in negative equity .
Aviva lost 33.4 per cent to 189.9p , a record low .
Prudential dropped 20 per cent to 221p , while Legal & General was down 28.9 per cent to 26.7p and Friends Provident slid 13.5 per cent to 60.7p.

Defensive sectors dominated the list of gainers .

The hedge fund said last July that the regulatory process to a bid would take 12-18 months .
Harbinger 's news offset a warning from shipping group AP Moller-Maersk .
Weakening demand from maritime customers has been a key concern ahead of Inmarsat 's full-year results next week .
Rolls-Royce was down 7.8 per cent to 262 1/4 p after Bernstein Research started coverage with an " underperform " rating and 250p target price .

Among the mid-caps , Spice bounced 2.3 per cent to 44 1/2 p after Brewin Dolphin said concerns over its accounting methods were exaggerated .

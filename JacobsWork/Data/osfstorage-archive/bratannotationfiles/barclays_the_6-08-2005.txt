Barclays THE
Few investors think of Barclays as a growth business .
But with risk-weighted assets up 20 per cent in the first six months of 2005 and revenues increasing by 14 per cent , this is an increasingly apt description .
Most important , the bank is expanding profitably .
Return on equity is a fat 23 per cent and this half 's Pounds 2.7bn pre-tax result was well ahead of expectations .
Most of the credit goes to the wholesale businesses - Barclays Capital , Barclays Global Investors and UK business banking - which account for 60 per cent of the bottom line .
In its low-key way , the group has built some impressive businesses .
Barclays and HSBC have both been investing heavily in organic expansion of investment banking .
Yet while BarCap increased profits by a fifth in the first half , HSBC 's investment bank saw an 18 per cent decline .
Meanwhile , BGI , known as a passive investment manager , now contains the world 's largest institutionally owned hedge fund , with more than Dollars 10bn of assets .
While Barclays is pouring money into these divisions , it has shown that it can clamp down on costs elsewhere .
UK banking achieved its three-year target of a 6 percentage point reduction in the cost/ income ratio in just six months - though expenses will rise in the second half to help jump-start revenues on the retail side .
And Barclays will keep the dividend growing even as it rebuilds its capital ratios following the Absa acquisition .
Given its momentum , a 2006 multiple of 10 times earnings looks attractive .

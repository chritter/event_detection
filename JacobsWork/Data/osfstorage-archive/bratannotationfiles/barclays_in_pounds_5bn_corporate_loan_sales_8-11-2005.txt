Barclays in Pounds 5bn corporate loan sales
Barclays is launching one of the largest ever sales of corporate loan risk by a UK bank this week , hot on the heels of a similar deal from HSBC , which is currently being shown to investors .
HSBC could price its Pounds 2bn sale of corporate loans from its own balance sheet as early as next week , according to one person close to the deal .
But that issue is about to be trumped by Barclays Pounds 5bn deal .
The sales take the form of collateralised loan obligations ( CLO ) , but while HSBC 's is a true sale cash CLO of the loans on its balance sheet , Barclays ' deal will be a fully-funded synthetic CLO .
The Barclays deal , while being constructed from credit derivatives rather than the actual loans , will still act similarly to the HSBC cash deal because almost the full amount of the deal will be sold in Pounds 4.41bn of AAA-rated super senior tranches .
The assets backing the deal come from Barclays Pounds 8bn book of loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and is designed to give the bank regulatory and economic capital relief on its balance sheet .
HSBC is set to sell all tranches of its deal down to the sub- investment grade BB-rated tranches and will retain only Pounds 40m of first-loss exposure in an unrated tranche , according to a person close to the deal .
The Barclays sale takes the form of a huge super senior tranche with a number of other , smaller tranches .
Standard & Poor 's , the rating agency , which issued its ratings on the deal yesterday , said the exact splits between each class of note into sterling , euros and US dollars would be determined when the deal had closed .

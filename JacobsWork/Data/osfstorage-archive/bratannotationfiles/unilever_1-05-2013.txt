Unilever
Why would you do something like this ?
On Monday , investors could have bought shares in India 's Hindustan Unilever for Rs500 .
Yesterday Unilever , which already owns just over half of HUL , offered Rs600 to buy up to another 23 per cent of it .
That values HUL at 36 times forecast earnings .
Unilever 's shareholders should be asking what they will be getting for such a huge valuation that they could not have bought more cheaply a day earlier .
Unilever says the deal is earnings-enhancing .
Irrelevant .
And according to Morgan Stanley , the debt to finance the purchase costs EUR91m to service .
In exchange , the company will keep EUR110m of HUL earnings that would otherwise have gone to minorities .
So a EUR19m gain versus Unilever 's forecast earnings of EUR5bn .
Are there other reasons for such largesse ?
Cost savings are not one of them .
Unilever already controls HUL , so it is tough to see where any new savings would come from .
Any big change on that front requires full ownership .
Unilever says that HUL is a valued local brand and that it does not want to buy out the rest .
And the higher valuation accorded to HUL 's shares ( 30 times earnings before Tuesday 's offer , against 19 for Unilever itself ) is a handy benchmark for Unilever 's emerging markets business .
That said , increasing the stake from 52 per cent to 75 per cent does make a full buyout easier if it ever decides to go down that route .
But there might be a Machiavellian purpose .
HUL minorities were aghast this year when Unilever increased the royalty charge that it levies over its Indian subsidiary from 1.4 per cent of sales to more than 3 per cent .
New Indian regulations could beef up minority rights .
Good reason , perhaps , for Unilever to increase its influence now .
Whatever the reason , HUL shareholders should jump at the generous price .
But Unilever 's owners deserve a better explanation .

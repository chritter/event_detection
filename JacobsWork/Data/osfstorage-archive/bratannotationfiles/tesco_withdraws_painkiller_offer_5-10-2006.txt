Tesco withdraws painkiller offer
Tesco , the retail giant , has withdrawn a " two for one " offer for painkillers after being warned by the British medicines watchdog that it violated the spirit of legislation to limit pack sizes for drugs and reduce the risk of suicides .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency wrote to Tesco in August after receiving a complaint from Boots that its rival had begun a multiple purchase off for Resolve and Resolve Extra in late July .
The MHRA judged that the move risked encouraging the unnecessary purchase of medicines .
Restrictions introduced eight years ago are designed to limit sales to a maximum of 100 tablets in a single transaction without a prescription .
Additional voluntary measures with retailers limit sales to two packs at a time .

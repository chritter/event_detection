Tesco poised to make profits history
Tesco is expected to make corporate history on Tuesday by being the first UK retailer to announce profits in excess of pound(s)3bn , but celebrations are likely to be short-lived , writes Samantha Pearson .
While the group remains Britain 's biggest supermarket chain , it has been gradually losing market share in the downturn as its rivals lure customers with recession-friendly discounts .
Investors will therefore be awaiting evidence in the full-year results that Tesco 's attempts to adapt its offering through monitoring customer spending have helped to maintain UK sales growth .
Expected heavy trading losses in the US market are likely to bring the group 's US chain , Fresh & Easy , under scrutiny again and operations in Ireland and central Europe could cause concern given the severity of the recession in these regions .
The other talking point will be Tesco 's net debt , which although still manageable is likely to exceed the group 's previous target of pound(s)8bn and could stunt short-term store growth .
Tesco , however , is likely to reassure long-term investors with promising performance from its recent acquisition in South Korea and words of encouragement on its new initiative to introduce 30 in-store banks this year .
Pre-tax profits are forecast at just more than pound(s)3bn from expected revenues of pound(s)53.5bn , according to consensus analyst estimates from Thomson Reuters .

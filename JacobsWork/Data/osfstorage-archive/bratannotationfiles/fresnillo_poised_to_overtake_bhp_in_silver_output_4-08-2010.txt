Fresnillo poised to overtake BHP in silver output
MINING
Fresnillo said it was poised to overtake BHP Billiton and become the world 's largest silver producer by the end of next year after it announced bumper profits in its half-year results yesterday .
Pre-tax profits for the Mexico-based miner rose to $354.4m , up from $179.9m on the same period last year , on the back of high gold and silver prices and increased production .
That was underpinned by sales of $605.6m , buoyed by the average price of gold and silver , which has risen by more than a quarter because of investor fears of sovereign debt risk .
The company said it would pay a dividend of 9.2 cents per share .
Much of that will be accrued by Alberto Bailleres , the Mexican billionaire who is a majority shareholder in Penoles mining group , which owns 77 per cent of Fresnillo .
At present , Fresnillo is the largest primary producer of silver but third behind BHP and Poland 's KGHM Polska Miedz - which produces silver as a by-product of other metals - according to a 2010 survey by GFMS , a precious metals consultancy .
Jaime Lomelin , Fresnillo chief executive , says that the opening of the Saucito mine in central Mexico next year will eventually add 9m extra ounces to overall production .
" Saucito is opening in the first semester of next year with a capacity of 4.5m [ rising ] to 9m ounces .
By the end of 2011 , we will be producing 43m ounces of primary silver and we will become the largest producer of silver overall . "
Fresnillo said profits were aided by record output at the northern Herradura gold mine , which helped pushed overall production up to 176,351 ounces , up 32.7 per cent .
In the short term , analysts say the price of gold will remain stable relative to silver , which is used in everything from solar energy panels to plasma computer screens .
If global economic activity falters , silver is more likely to be held hostage to investor demand for " haven " assets .
" [ Fresnillo ] are cautious about nearer-term economic recovery and industrial demand for silver , which accounts for about 47 per cent of total demand .
" If that falters it can only be made up by higher demand from the investment side , " said Charles Cooper , a mining analyst at Oriel Securities .
Fresnillo 's diluted earnings per share were 30 cents , up from 16.9 cents .
Its shares closed up 12 pence to pound(s)10.70 in London .

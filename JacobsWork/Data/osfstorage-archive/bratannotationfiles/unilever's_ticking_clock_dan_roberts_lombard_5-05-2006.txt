Unilever 's ticking clock DAN ROBERTS LOMBARD
Patrick Cescau rightly points out that his job as Unilever chief executive should be to sustain growth in the top line and improve margins .
Sadly , yesterday 's 2 per cent increase in turnover and 0.2 per cent decline in operating margin was not satisfactory .
One quarter is too soon to declare this recovery stalled , but the continued slide in European sales ( still more than a third of Unilever 's business ) is an alarming sign of how much more he has to do .
Getting a company this big to start innovating like its nimbler competitors may simply prove too much even for the admired Mr Cescau .
The alternatives are equally unpalatable but deserve constant reappraisal .
One much-rumoured option is a leveraged buy-out that would finally smash the record set by KKR 's Dollars 31bn record bid for RJR Nabisco .
Adjusted for today 's prices , Unilever would be a similar size and would provide rich pickings .
Better still would be to take some of their methods and apply them in-house .
Given the success of more focused competitors such as Danone and Reckitt , the perennial question of whether Unilever needs to be split into separate food and household and personal care ( HPC ) companies deserves serious consideration .
Given its controversial decision to maintain dual listings in London and Amsterdam it could simply reverse 76 years of history and create a UK HPC business called Lever Brothers and a Dutch food group called Unie .

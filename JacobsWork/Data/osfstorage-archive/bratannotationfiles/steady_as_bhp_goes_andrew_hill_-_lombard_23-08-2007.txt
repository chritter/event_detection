Steady as BHP goes ANDREW HILL - LOMBARD
Handing over the helm of a blue-chip company in the middle of a market storm sounds perilous .
But at BHP Billiton , where Chip Goodyear will pass the chief executive 's cap to Marius Kloppers in September , it looks as though the credit crunch never happened .
No halt to the share buy-back programme ( on the contrary , the company says , this would be a good time to buy its own stock on the cheap ) , no let-up in demand from China and India , no problem in getting financing , should it be needed , for further expansion .
BHP acknowledges that a spillover from financial crisis into the world economy would have an impact , but says emerging market growth is underpinned by domestic demand .
The group has backed its bullish outlook with a rebased dividend a good 5 per cent higher than analysts had expected and nearly 50 per cent up on last year 's final pay-out .
Perhaps the only downside of these results was that they provided more of a boost to rivals ' shares yesterday than to BHP itself .
Still , with most analysts setting their 12-month share price targets at least Pounds 2 above yesterday 's closing level of Pounds 13.65 , that is barely a blip on the radar for Captain Kloppers .

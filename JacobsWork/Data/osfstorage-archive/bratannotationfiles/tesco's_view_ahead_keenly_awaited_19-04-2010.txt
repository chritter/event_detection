Tesco 's view ahead keenly awaited
Tesco , the world 's third-biggest grocer by sales , delivers its annual results tomorrow , writes Elizabeth Rigby .
Analysts expect group sales to rise 9 per cent to pound(s)59bn , and pre-tax profit to rise more than 6 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn.
As Tesco is the bellwether for the UK consumer economy , investors will be keen to hear chief executive Sir Terry Leahy 's views on the outlook for retail spending and for grocers , who face slowing growth on the back of falling food price inflation .
This is important for Tesco given that about 70 per cent of its profits come from its UK arm .
Analysts will want to hear how its retailing services arm , which includes the banking division , is performing .
They will want evidence that the bank remains on track , given that it is yet to launch mortgages and current accounts in spite of a promise to shake up retail banking a year ago .
Bernstein Research has pencilled in operating profits of pound(s)263m , or 10 per cent of the UK operating profit , for the year to March .
Results in Tesco 's international business - Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities expects revenues to be 13.4 per cent higher at pound(s)18.3bn - will be mixed , with continental Europe hard hit .
Shore Capital expects profits there , given the struggles of economies such as the Irish Republic and Hungary , to be down 10 per cent .
Analysts are also pencilling in more losses at Fresh & Easy , Tesco 's US convenience chain , although Clive Black of Shore Capital thinks the chain might have reached its nadir .

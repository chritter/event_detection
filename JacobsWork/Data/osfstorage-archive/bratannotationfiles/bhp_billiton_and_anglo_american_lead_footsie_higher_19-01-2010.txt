BHP Billiton and Anglo American lead Footsie higher
LONDON
BHP Billiton and Anglo American were among the biggest gainers yesterday as mining stocks lifted the London market .
BHP took on 1.5 per cent to pound(s)20.74 1/2 amid hopes it would restart its share buyback programme at interim results next month .
The group suspended its buyback in late 2007 , when it still had $4.2bn remaining to return to shareholders , to pursue its failed bid for Rio Tinto .
UBS said BHP was in a strong position to restart the programme , forecasting the group would generate $7bn of surplus cash over the next 18 months .
Releasing the $4.2bn currently set aside would only boost earnings per share by about 1 per cent , analyst Olivia Ker said .
However , UBS also noted that BHP 's Australian listing has been trading at a premium of 21 per cent to the UK shares .
Management would likely target any buyback funds towards London to narrow this gap , it said .
Sector peer Anglo American gained 3.2 per cent to pound(s)28.09 on the back of " buy " advice from Merrill Lynch .
" We believe that if management are not seen to be delivering both operationally and strategically by mid-late 2010 , Xstrata could be back to bid again , " Merrill told clients .
The broker also raised its Anglo target price to pound(s)37.50 to reflect a rebound in platinum prices .
A weaker dollar buoyed the rest of the miners , which helped lift the FTSE 100 by 39.02 points or 0.7 per cent to 5,494.39.
Xstrata ended 2.4 per cent higher at pound(s)12.16 1/2 , while Rio took on 0.9 per cent at pound(s)36.15 and Kazakhmys rose 2.5 per cent to pound(s)14.45.
ENRC was the biggest gainer , rising 3.9 per cent to pound(s)10.30 after Kazakhmys said it had no current plans to sell its 26 per cent stake but would look at other options .
British Airways was up 1.1 per cent to 194 3/4 p after Credit Suisse chose the airline as its preferred pick in a European sector note .
" BA is the carrier most leveraged to the recovery of the transatlantic market , " it said .
Lloyds Banking Group took on 3.2 per cent to 58 1/2 p amid renewed talk it could sell its insurance business to Resolution .
Shares in Clive Cowdery 's consolidation vehicle rose 1.9 per cent to 85 3/4 p.
International Power led the blue-chip fallers , down 3.4 per cent to 311p , on news its talks with GDF-Suez had collapsed .
The shares had traded as high as 353 1/2 p in opening trade following reports that GDF was lining up a bid .
However , it is thought the talks only related to a merger of assets outside their home markets which would have been funded by International Power stock .
A fresh competition threat from BT Group weighed on BSkyB , with the telecoms group saying it will start a price war for sports coverage if the regulator cuts wholesale prices .
BT was up 1.3 per cent to 147p .
BSkyB lost 1.1 per cent to 567p , even though most analysts said the risk was negligible .
BAE Systems slipped 0.9 per cent to 364 3/4 p after Investec started coverage with a " hold " rating based on concerns about public spending .
" Sentiment will be the key driver in 2010 , principally the defence market backdrop , with cuts probable , exacerbated in the UK by delays resulting from the general election and Strategic Defence Review , " the broker said .
Among the mid-caps , Logica was down 0.6 per cent to 123 1/2 p following a trade press report that it had botched a deal to supply case-management software at the UK Supreme Court .
Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor called the reported failure a " schoolboy error " at a time when a change of government would likely result in deep cuts to state IT spending .
Heritage Oil jumped 7.3 per cent to 524p after a statement from the Kurdish Regional Government boosted hopes its dispute with Iraq over oil revenue may be near a resolution .
Vague rumours of M&A helped boost the engineering sector , with GKN moving up 1 per cent to 128 1/2 p.
Rightmove edged 0.2 per cent lower to 528 1/2 p as markets shrugged off the launch of a competing website by estate agent Countrywide , formerly its biggest shareholder .

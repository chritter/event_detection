Unilever restructures LEX
Plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose .
Unilever shares bounced 4 per cent yesterday on the announcement of another push to cut costs and reshuffle its portfolio of businesses .
Planned spending on restructuring between 2007-09 is to more than double to Euros 3bn , with the aim of exceeding a 15 per cent operating margin by 2010 .
The money will go towards further streamlining of management , axing a tenth of the workforce , and improving distribution .
There is a rather strong sense , however , that Unilever has been here before .
The " path to growth " programme launched in 1999 , aimed to pep up revenues and deliver a 15 per cent operating margin , by spending Euros 5bn on restructuring over four years .
Margins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13.7 per cent .
Restructuring has become a cost of doing business in a mature , competitive industry , with the resultant savings tough to retain .
Similarly , the group says it hopes to dispose of businesses generating more than Euros 2bn of annual sales , including the North American laundry operations .
It is tempting to see the hand of new chairman Michael Treschow here , brought on board as an outsider with a reputation for successful surgery at Electrolux .
Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposals since 2000 have carved out Euros 8bn worth of revenues .
Meanwhile , growth remains a problem .
Developing markets , contributing two-fifths of sales and expanding at 10 per cent a year , are responsible for virtually all Unilever 's sales growth .
In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain sluggish .
So while Unilever expects to hit the top end of its 3-5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still lags behind peers .
Reckitt Benckiser grew at twice that rate in the first half , and Nestle is running at about a 7.5 per cent pace .
The new , new leaf at Unilever has yet to be turned .

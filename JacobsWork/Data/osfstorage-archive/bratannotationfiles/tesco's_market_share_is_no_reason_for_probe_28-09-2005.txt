Tesco 's market share is no reason for probe
From Mr Robin Creswell .
Sir , The suggestion is that it is " unfair " that a merger of Asda with J . Sainsbury would automatically be referred to the Office of Fair Trading , while Tesco is apparently free to expand without investigation .
This is probably wrong , since with a merger or takeover , competition , the principal subject of an investigation , is eliminated not through consumer choice , but through corporate action - something over which the public has little influence .
By comparison , Tesco 's expansion continues by virtue of its competitive edge and what it offers customers .
Consumers decide that Tesco 's expansion will continue by choosing to shop there .
Provided a level playing field exists without distortions that favour one company over another , market share alone should not be a reason to investigate a company .

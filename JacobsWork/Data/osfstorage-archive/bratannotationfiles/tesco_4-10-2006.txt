Tesco
Investing heavily in expansion while handing back sufficient cash to keep shareholders happy is a tricky balancing act for Tesco .
The retailer 's planned capital expenditure for the year is a chunky Pounds 3.2bn , which is at the higher end of market expectations .
The dividend payout works out at only about a third of that but , as promised last year , the 11 per cent increase in the interim dividend is in line with earnings growth , boosted by profits from property sales .
These reached Pounds 74m in the first half and are expected to continue apace , as Tesco reduces the amount of property it owns from 85 per cent to about 70 per cent of its portfolio .
The group 's share buy-back programme is now running , though the Pounds 1.5bn targeted over the next five years is insignificant in the context of the company 's near Pounds 30bn capitalisation .
Still , a dividend yield approaching 2.8 per cent this year seems acceptable for a company investing heavily in growth opportunities .
And despite a difficult time in Hungary , the company 's growth credentials are intact , with plenty of scope in both eastern Europe and Asia .
In the UK , like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter of 6.6 per cent year-on-year looks roughly in line , rather than ahead of competitors .
If anything , the most immediate risk may lie in stronger price competitiveness in the UK market .
Tesco 's US expansion , though , remains shrouded in secrecy ahead of the first store openings next year : the slide in the group 's presentation representing US plans showed an empty stretch of mud with two trucks - presumably soon to be a building site .
But the relatively small size of the investment - Pounds 250m annually for the next few years - should encourage investors to be patient .

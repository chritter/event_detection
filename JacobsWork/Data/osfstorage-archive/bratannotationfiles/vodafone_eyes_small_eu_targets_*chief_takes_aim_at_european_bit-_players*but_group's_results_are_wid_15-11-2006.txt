Vodafone eyes small EU targets *Chief takes aim at European bit- players*But group 's results are wide of the mark
Vodafone predicted yesterday that some mobile operators would be squeezed out of European markets , and said the group could be interested in buying such businesses .
Arun Sarin , chief executive of Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile operator by revenue , forecast consolidation in European markets because of the ferocity of competition .
He said Vodafone would " look at these assets as they become available " .
He also said Vodafone could expand in emerging markets and raised the prospect of the group increasing its stake in Bharti , India 's biggest mobile operator .
Mr Sarin 's upbeat remarks about potential acquisition activity came as Vodafone reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.3bn for the six months to September 30 , compared with a Pounds 3.9bn profit for the same period last year .
The loss was principally the result of an Pounds 8.1bn impairment charge on the goodwill of its German and Italian businesses .
Vodafone had earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of Pounds 6.2bn for the six months of its 2006-07 fiscal year , up 3 per cent on an organic basis .
Revenue was Pounds 15.6bn , up 4 per cent on an organic basis , and free cash flow was Pounds 3bn , down 9 per cent .
The interim dividend was 2.35p , up 7 per cent .
Vodafone 's shares closed down 0.5p yesterday at 135.5p.
Vodafone reiterated its May guidance of slowing revenue growth and a declining profit margin in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 .
In the first half of 2006-07 , strong revenue growth in Vodafone 's businesses in emerging markets helped offset falling sales in some of its core European operations .
Businesses in eastern Europe , the Middle East , Africa , and Asia reported revenue of Pounds 3.1bn for 2006-07 , up 21 per cent on an organic basis .
Mr Sarin predicted Europe would see some smaller mobile operators " closing their shops and going home " because , against a backdrop of price cutting , only big players such as Vodafone could realise cost savings through economies of scale .
He said consolidation could take place in the UK , the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe .
" We will certainly look at assets within our geographic scope , " he added .
Any deals would have to pass Vodafone 's financial criteria but Mr Sarin said the group would look at Hutchison Whampoa 's mobile businesses in Italy and the UK if they were put up for sale .
Mr Sarin also said Vodafone could pursue " selective acquisitions " in Africa , Asia and eastern Europe but stressed no businesses had been " targeted " .
Vodafone has a 10 per cent stake in Bharti , and Mr Sarin said " over the next several years " the group could find ways of " increasing our share " .
He also said Vodafone was keen to maximise its participation in China , where it already has a 3 per cent stake in China Mobile .

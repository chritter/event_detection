Vodafone resilient on renewed talk of Verizon stake sale
LONDON
Vodafone was among the few resilient features yesterday as the FTSE 100 swung by 180 points to close sharply lower .
Vodafone closed up 1.4 per cent to 126.85p as speculation revived that it could sell its minority stake in Verizon Wireless once credit conditions ease .
That followed AT&T this week rearranging its mobile and consumer wire line businesses into a single division .
The move could force Verizon , co-owner of Vodafone 's US wireless joint venture , to follow suit , MF Global analysts said .
" In the past , we think Verizon felt the need to pay a full price for Vodafone 's stake , " said the broker .
" AT&T is making Verizon feel the need now . "
Traders were cautious on the theory .
While a sale would allow Vodafone 's new chief executive Vittorio Colao to return about 50p per share to investors , it would also risk putting the company in play further down the line , they said .
A Morgan Stanley note also helped underpin Vodafone shares .
The broker kept a 170p target price , citing market research suggesting there had been no significant change in spending in the company 's key European markets .
The FTSE 100 was down 1.8 per cent by the close , losing 89.25 points at 4,870.33 in reaction to weak US data .

From its record high in May the FTSE 350 Mining Index has lost 54.9 per cent to reach a two-year low .
Vedanta Resources was the day 's sharpest faller , down 11.9 per cent to 912p .
The stock has dropped 46 per cent in a fortnight as weak iron ore and copper prices look likely to weigh on its Indian operations and put its Zambian subsidiary in the red .
Vedanta also needs to tap debt markets for $2.6bn by January , assuming the US courts approve its deal to buy copper miner Asarco out of bankruptcy protection .
The loan forms part of an expansion budget that will exceed free cashflow by $7.4bn over the next three years , according to Cazenove .
Antofagasta slipped 8.3 per cent to 349p , Rio Tinto lost 7.9 per cent to 349p and BHP Billiton was off 7.3 per cent to pound(s)11.21.
Oil stocks matched the trend , with Tullow dropping 10.2 per cent to 638 1/2 p in spite of a generally positive response to its investor day .
HBOS led the blue-chip risers , ahead 14.9 per cent to 170.1p , while Lloyds TSB was up 4.8 per cent to 262p .
That narrowed the discount on Lloyds ' all-share takeover offer to 22 per cent , compared with 38 per cent on Tuesday .
Separately , Commonwealth Bank of Australia denied a report that it had approached HBOS with an offer to buy the retail operations of its Australian business , BankWest .

UBS this week put a " short-term sell " recommendation on SAB ahead of its trading update due on October 14 , arguing that sales in key markets such as South Africa and Colombia are likely to disappoint .
Marks and Spencer bounced 8.1 per cent to 227 1/4 p after reporting second-quarter sales broadly in line with expectations .
Next rose 3.8 per cent to pound(s)10.99.
Leading the FTSE 250 , directories publisher Yell bounced 11.8 per cent to 90p on rumours it was nearing a deal with institutional debt holders .
Yell was also helped by Invesco , its largest shareholder , raising its stake to more than 20 per cent .
Logica slid 5 per cent to 100 3/4 p after Petercam set an 82p target on the IT services group , which set out a restructuring plan in April .
" We expect that the economic headwind in the coming year will wipe out an important part of the restructuring benefits and push down the valuation premium , " it said .

BHP responds to Rio with record output
By REBECCA BREAM and PETER SMITH
BHP Billiton , the mining company , has reported record production figures for a number of commodities including iron ore , mirroring a similarly strong performance at takeover target Rio Tinto , which published production figures last week .
BHP said it had achieved " record or equal record production " in seven commodities in the six months to December .
That comes two weeks before a UK Takeover Panel deadline for the AngloAustralian mining group to either table a firm offer for Rio Tinto or walk away for at least six months .
In November , BHP approached Rio with a take-over proposal offering three BHP shares for each Rio share , worth about Pounds 65bn , which was rejected .
There was mounting speculation yesterday that BHP would make a decision on whether to launch a formal bid at a board meeting in Melbourne next Wednesday .
The company would not confirm whether a meeting was scheduled , however , and said : " No decision has been made on the course of action . "
Sources close to BHP said the company could convene a board meeting to make a decision on Rio " at any time " .
It is looking increasingly likely that BHP will wait until February 6 to make its move , the final deadline set by the Takeover Panel and the same day as the company 's half-year results .
BHP has been keen to highlight the strength of its business at a time when Rio has set out a robust defence of it remaining independent .
Michael Rawlinson at Liberum Capital said BHP 's production figures were strong , with the key divisions of iron ore and copper " performing well " .
But he said the figures did not change the relative positions of BHP and Rio , adding that BHP would have to improve the terms of its three-for-one takeover proposal to win control of Rio .
" A bump will still be necessary to win this prize - something that we feel the hungry BHP has the requisite desire to deliver , " Mr Rawlinson said .
BHP said strong markets allowed it to notch up records in petroleum - including natural gas - alumina , copper concentrate , iron ore , manganese ore and alloy .
Its Western Australia iron ore business recorded its eighth consecutive production record .
Iron ore production rose 9 per in the second quarter and was up 8 per cent in the latest half .
Petroleum rose 10 per cent in the quarter and by 5 per cent in the half .
Alumina was flat on the quarter , but rose 4 per cent during the half , while aluminium was flat in both the quarter and half .
However , energy coal slipped by 2 per cent in the half year , while nickel production , hit by the shutdown of smelters , was down 11 per cent over the same period .
Shares in BHP fell 24p to Pounds 12.76 while those in Rio shed 92p to Pounds 42.03.

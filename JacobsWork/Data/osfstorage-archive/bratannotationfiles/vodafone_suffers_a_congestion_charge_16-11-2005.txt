Vodafone suffers a congestion charge
Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , felt " slightly congested " while presenting interim results yesterday .
The 11 per cent , or Pounds 9bn , drop in the company 's market capitalisation should clear the head better than a lifetime of lozenges .
Results were good , the outlook less so .
Japan faces further " significant " margin pressure next year and could make an operating loss .
A rapid recovery is unlikely .
NTT DoCoMo , with sales four times larger , expects only a 10 per cent return on capital this year .
It spends 37 per cent of sales on customer retention and acquisition , compared with 28 per cent for Vodafone Japan .
At least Japan has disappointed its way to irrelevance - it now contributes just4 per cent of Vodafone 's operating income .
In Europe , Vodafone expects a modest dip in margins and intensifying competition in Germany and Italy .
Finally , Vodafone expects Pounds 5bn of one-off tax payments .
Taking a step back , it is genuinely surprising that the market is so upset .
A Pounds 9bn tax provision sits on the balance sheet - a fair clue that historically low cash tax payments might reverse .
Admittedly earnings forecasts for next year should fallby 5-8 per cent .
But this says more about the City 's failure to " kitchen sink " its Japan estimates than a new industrial reality .
Vodafone could have increased its cash payout from the current 100 per cent of free cash flow .
Still , it has big , legitimate acquisition opportunities .
On the basis of today 's capricious reaction , relying on equity markets to fund these might be foolish .

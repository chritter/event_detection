Unilever half way EUROPEAN COMMENT - BRIAN GROOM
So the Anglo-Dutch model staggers on , mortally wounded .
After the sweeping unification of Royal Dutch/ Shell and the earlier successful merger of Reed Elsevier 's management structures , Unilever has only half-grasped its chance .
It can only be a matter of time .
The ending of the consumer products group 's 75-year-old dual chairman/ chief executive structure is the minimum needed to appease investors after two years of slow sales and profits growth .
But for now it still leaves Unilever with dual headquarters in London and Rotterdam , dual share listings in the UK and the Netherlands , and the same leaders in charge .
At least Antony Burgmans will have a non-executive role as chairman , leaving Patrick Cescau unencumbered as chief executive .
Some shareholders are upset that Mr Burgmans , tainted by the failed " Path to Growth " strategy , will not make way for an independent chairman until 2007 .
He should try to redeem himself by ensuring his structural review quickly embraces full merger .
Structural changes alone will not rescue Unilever but should bring clarity .
Mr Cescau , apart from stepping up marketing and cutting costs , needs to focus on powerful brands and new products .
That will be easier if they do not have to pass endless committees before being launched . european.comment@ft.com www.ft.com/ eurocomment

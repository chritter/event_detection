Tesco
In the real estate equivalent of supermarket sweep , could Tesco put its property portfolio into a trolley marked " Reit " ?
Wednesday 's Budget opened the way for the development of a UK real estate investment trust market .
It is logical that Tesco , with a freehold property portfolio with a conservative book value of Pounds 12bn , should consider its options .
Conversion to Reit status may not be straightforward .
Draft legislation published in December does not allow for owner-occupied property to be part of a Reit and there was no mention of altering this on Budget day .
Tesco believes in the benefits of retaining control and flexibility over scarce land .
In creating a Reit , it would have to relinquish ownership , similar to a sale-and-lease-back transaction .
There are benefits : Tesco would avoid capital gains tax on the asset sales , which should far outweigh the one-off cost to convert .
Rental income in the Reit would be tax free , but lease payments are tax deductible , providing an ongoing benefit .
It is less clear that Tesco has the right balance sheet to extract these benefits , assuming the proceeds were returned to shareholders .
Tesco 's net debt is not that large , but capital expenditure is high .
Operating free cash flow does not cover annual interest , tax and dividend expense , even before considering the additional constraint of lease payments of , say , Pounds 500m .
Investors should not hold their breath for a Reit-related share buy- back .

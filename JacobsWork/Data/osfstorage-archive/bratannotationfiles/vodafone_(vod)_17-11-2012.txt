Vodafone ( VOD )
The mobile phone group 's hefty loss reflects a pound(s)5.9bn impairment charge against its struggling Spanish and Italian operations
Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound(s)2.4bn dividend from US operator Verizon Wireless , in which Vodafone owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with Verizon Communications .
Vodafone 's management will use the cash to fund a pound(s)1.5bn share buy-back programme .
Cash profits attributable to Vodafone from Verizon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound(s)4.49bn - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2.2 per cent to pound(s)6.2bn.
Emerging markets were also relatively strong - particularly Turkey - but sharp falls in southern Europe wiped out those gains .
Progress at offsetting declines in voice and messaging revenues looks slow , too .
Mobile data revenue climbed 4 per cent to pound(s)1.64bn in the second quarter and voice and messaging combined saw revenue slump 14 per cent to pound(s)6.87bn.
Broker Bernstein forecasts full-year adjusted earnings per share of 15.25p ( 14.91p in 2012 ) , rising to 15.79p in 2014 .
Vodafone has a great record for returning cash to shareholders and there 's a fat yield .
Much depends on Verizon Wireless 's performance , and southern European operations remain problematic , so there are few obvious catalysts ahead for a re-rating .
But Vodafone is n't likely to be a growth business , and the dividend is still a major attraction .

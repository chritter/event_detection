Vodafone
Vodafone investors would annoy Mr Spock : they keep acting illogically .
On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture with Verizon Communications , ruled out regular dividends .
This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $10bn dividend - its first since 2005 .
Investors should not make decisions based on dividend announcements as , ceteris paribus , their payment does not affect a company 's valuation .
And in this case , it would only make a difference if Vittorio Colao , chief executive , could use the money more efficiently than Verizon Wireless and could not source it more cheaply elsewhere .
Vodafone , however , generates so much cash that it might as well be a printing press - Mr Colao had to make a pound(s)2bn special payment to Vodafone shareholders just to deal with the $4.5bn received from its share of July 's Verizon Wireless dividend .
Any further distributions would probably go straight through Vodafone in the same way .
Some investors who stayed loyal to Vodafone during the acrimonious years after 2005 may scoff at Verizon 's reason for cutting future dividends - that it wants to stockpile cash for capital expenditure ( mainly on radio spectrum ) or acquisitions .
It is not a secret that Verizon stopped paying dividends in an effort to force Vodafone to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to Verizon .
But since then Verizon Wireless 's trapped cash has been put to good use repaying its debt and Vodafone and Verizon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) .
That suggests Mr Colao trusts Verizon 's plans .
So the issue is whether Vodafone shareholders trust Mr Colao .
So far , he deserves trust .
And that means that a US dividend should be far from the front of investors ' minds .

Vodafone to talk to unions about Spanish job losses
Vodafone will today start talks with trade unions in Spain about cutting its workforce in the recession-hit country after taking a hefty writedown on the value of its operations in southern Europe .
Vodafone , which employs 4,300 people in Spain , declined to say how many jobs were at risk at its operations in the country , where revenues fell 11 per cent in the six months to September last year .
The decision to reduce jobs follows the announcement in 2011 by Telefonica , Spain 's former telecoms monopoly , that it would cut 6,500 domestic positions by the end of this year .
The big telecoms groups in Spain , where Vodafone is the second-largest operator by clients , have suffered because of a price war with lower-cost rivals such as Jazztel at a time when a quarter of Spaniards are unemployed .
In November , Vodafone was forced to write down pound(s)5.9bn from the value of its businesses in Spain , Italy and Greece , dragging the operator to a first-half pre-tax loss of pound(s)492m - down from an pound(s)8bn profit in the year before .
Vodafone has already implemented reductions to salaries and working days at its Spanish operations to cut costs as revenues have continued to fall .

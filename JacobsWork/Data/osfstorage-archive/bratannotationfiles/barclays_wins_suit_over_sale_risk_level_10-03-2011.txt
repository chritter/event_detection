Barclays wins suit over sale risk level
BANKS
Barclays has won a lawsuit brought against it by Italian bank San Marino , which had alleged the UK bank had sold it complex debt products that were " much riskier " than the triple A credit rating they had been given .
Cassa di Risparmio di San Marino bank had claimed EUR92m ( pound(s)78m ) in losses and lost income alleging fraudulent misrepresentation over the sale of complex collateralised debt obligations ( CDOs ) during a longrunning trial in the UK 's High Court .
Barclays had strongly denied the claims .
Mr Justice Hamblen ruled on Wednesday that San Marino 's claims all failed and must be dismissed , " despite the considerable skill with which the claimant 's case was constructed and presented " .
Barclays said it welcomed the ruling .
" We have consistently said this case was without merit and any factual basis , " it said .
The case centred around four sets of structured notes with a total nominal value of EUR406m sold by Barclays to San Marino in early 2005 .
The notes had embedded within them CDOs that gave exposure to the credit risk of a pool of assets , which itself included further CDOs .
San Marino had alleged that Barclays sold the notes on the basis of an agreed triple A rating , which it intended San Marino to rely on as indicating a minimal level of risk , when Barclays knew that the notes were far riskier than their credit rating indicated .
The case is one of a number of actions faced by banks over complex credit products that triggered widespread losses .

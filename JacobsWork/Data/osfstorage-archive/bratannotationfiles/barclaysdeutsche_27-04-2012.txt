Barclays / Deutsche
Are the investment banking arms of Barclays and Deutsche Bank digging in to make a stand against their US rivals ?
Last year Wall Street banks took market share from their European counterparts .
But first-quarter results from Barclays Capital and Deutsche 's investment bank yesterday , both stronger than Credit Suisse 's comparable figures the day before , show they are faring better than their regional peers - or , at least , not as badly , for now .
But one may be losing ground to the other .
Consider BarCap 's performance in fixed income , currencies and commodities , where revenue rose 9 per cent to pound(s)2.4bn from a year ago .
That suggests BarCap is maintaining , even increasing , its share .
Or take the unit 's equities revenue , up just 1 per cent .
Yet that makes BarCap and Morgan Stanley the only investment banks to report an increase so far .
Overall , revenue at the UK lender 's wholesale bank climbed 3 per cent , compared with Deutsche 's 11 per cent decline , itself in line with JPMorgan Chase 's comparable revenue drop .
Deutsche 's FICC machine , meanwhile , generated income of EUR3.4bn , 8 per cent lower than a year ago but still trumping its UK rival by EUR500m .
That may be less than the one-fifth FICC decline at Credit Suisse , but US peers ' equivalent revenues rose 5 per cent .
It was a different story in equities , however : the German investment bank 's revenue slid 23 per cent , although at EUR726m it was still higher than Barclays ' number .
But , as the European rivals tough it out , they face two obstacles closer to home .
For a start , the second quarter has started more slowly than the first , and could be flat .
And , from next January , they will have to contend with new EU rules ( Capital Requirements Directive 4 ) that will benefit less-constrained US banks .
No wonder Barclays and Deutsche can be had for about 0.6 times book value .

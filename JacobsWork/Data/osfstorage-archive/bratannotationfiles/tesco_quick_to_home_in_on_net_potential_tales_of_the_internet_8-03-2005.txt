Tesco quick to home in on net potential TALES OF THE INTERNET
When the dotcom boom took off in the 1990s , many retailers were caught on the back foot as start-ups rushed to grab a piece of the online shopping market .
But Tesco , the UK 's largest super-market group , was not among the laggards .
It was quick to embrace the internet as an alternative channel for its business and began trialling online shopping in 1996 .
Tesco says its website , launched in 1999 , is now the world 's most popular online grocer with 120,000 orders a week .
In the last financial year , Tesco 's online sales accounted for just less than two per cent - Pounds 577m - of total group sales of Pounds 33.5bn.
But this year - Tesco announces its year-end results on April 12 - it is thought that the retailer 's internet sales will have grown strongly after a buoyantChristmas .
Tesco will not disclose how much it has invested in its online offering but says the website , which sells hundreds of thousands of products , broke even in 2002 .
In the six months to August 14 online sales were up 27 per cent at Pounds 307m , while pre-tax profit was at Pounds 15m .
That is double the annual sales of JSainsbury and Ocado , the internet only retailer that sells Waitrose products , indicating the might of Tesco 's online reach .

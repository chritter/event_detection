Vodafone pays NZ$840m for rival Telstra business
Vodafone will more than double the size of its fixed-line telecoms business in New Zealand after buying rival TelstraClear for NZ$840m in cash from Australia 's Telstra Corp.
Vodafone , which is already the largest mobile phone operator in New Zealand with more than 2.4m customers , will take its share of the fixed-line business in the country to about 29 per cent at a time when customers will have greater access to high-speed broadband being rolled out by a government-backed scheme .
Telecom Corp will remain the market leader in fixed-line with close to half the market in New Zealand .
Vodafone has also bolstered its voice and data services and network infrastructure through the acquisition of TelstraClear , which owns a 6,600km fibre network connecting 19 of the country 's largest cities .
It also owns a cable TV and broadband access network .
The cash purchase is expected to close before the end of the year subject to regulatory approval .
Vodafone is paying about 6.3 times the company 's 2011 earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , slightly higher than average .
Vodafone said that the deal would create " significant savings from a combination of the two companies ' networks , commercial operations and administrative functions " , and would be accretive to earnings per share from the second year .

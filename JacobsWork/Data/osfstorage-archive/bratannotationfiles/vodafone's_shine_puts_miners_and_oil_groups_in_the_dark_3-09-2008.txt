Vodafone 's shine puts miners and oil groups in the dark
LONDON
The London market edged higher yesterday , as a strong performance from Vodafone helped offset weakness in mining and oil stocks .
Shares in the mobile phone group gained 2.7 per cent to 144.2p - adding 8 points to the FTSE 100 - on the view that it would be a beneficiary of sterling 's weakness against a number of currencies , in particular the US dollar and euro .
" Vodafone earns 55 per cent of its operating profits in euros plus around 27 per cent in US dollars , " Cazenove said , reiterating its " overweight " recommendation .
" Vodafone has previously highlighted that a 1 per cent change in the euro / sterling rate would impact revenues by pound(s)250m and operating profits by pound(s)70m . "
Vodafone was not the only stock to benefit from movements in the currency market .
Wolseley , the plumbing and building materials group that makes most of its money in the US , rose 5.4 per cent to 485 1/2 p.
Food retailer J Sainsbury , up 6.1 per cent to 370p , was also helped by the dollar in a roundabout way - a stronger dollar meant it was cheaper for the Qatar Investment Authority , which owns 27 per cent of the grocer , to bid .
Most of the QIA 's revenue comes from the oil and gas markets , which are dollar denominated .
Those performances helped the FTSE 100 close 17.9 points , or 0.3 per cent , higher at 5,620.7 in spite of the poor performances from oil and mining .
The FTSE 250 rose 134.1 points , or 1.4 per cent , to 9,543.6.
With commodity prices , especially oil , pressured by the resurgent dollar and nagging fears about slowing economic growth in emerging markets , Tullow Oil fell 5.1 per cent to 750 1/2 p , while BG Group dipped 4 per cent to pound(s)11.19 , Anglo American lost 4.8 per cent to pound(s)26.46 and Xstrata faded 4 per cent to pound(s)28.04.
However , the lower oil price was good news for a number of stocks including Carnival , up 7.4 per cent to pound(s)20.30 , British Airways , 4.4 per cent better at 273 1/4 p and tour operators Thomas Cook , 7.3 per cent stronger at 246 1/2 p , and Tui Travel , up 5.9 per cent to 229p .
On a different tack , retailer Next rose 5.6 per cent to pound(s)11.33 after JPMorgan told clients to expect a positive surprise on margins when the clothing retailer reports half results on September 10 .
" Although underlying sales trends continue to deteriorate , Next has planned for weak demand and kept its inventory tight .
As such , we think it had around 20 per cent less stock going into its summer clearance , with a slightly lower markdown percentage , " it said .
In the same sector , DSG International , the parent company of Currys , was marked 6.6 per cent higher at 52 3/4 p ahead of today 's trading statement .
Oriel Securities repeated its " buy " rating arguing that DSG 's customer support agreements and its Nordic business , Elkjop , were worth pound(s)1.3bn.
DSG 's current market value is close to pound(s)900m .
Prudential , rose 5 per cent to 578p after a push from Lehman Brothers .
" With the stock trading below embedded value , and with Asian sales likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next five years , we retain an overweight rating , " the broker , which has a 989p target price , said .
Premier Oil , off 9.1 per cent at pound(s)11 , took the FTSE 250 's wooden spoon .
The weak oil price and a downgrade from RBS did the damage .
Moving to a " hold " rating , RBS said the lack of commercial success at the Chim Cng well in Vietnam and a six month gap in Premier 's drilling schedule would weigh on the share price .
RBS also cut ratings on Venture Production , off 5.8 per cent to 737 1/2 p , and Salamander Energy , down 5.2 per cent at 250p .
Jardine Lloyd Thompson rose 2 per cent to 458 1/2 p on rumours of a bid approach .
Rival insurance broker Benfield , up 0.6 per cent to 354p , recently recommended a 350p-per-share bid from Aon .
But with a JLT director declaring the sale of stock yesterday , traders were sceptical of the rumours .
Housebuilders responded positively to attempts by the government to kick start the market with a package of measures , including an extension to stamp duty exemption .
Taylor Wimpey rose 8.5 per cent to 60 3/4 p , while Persimmon added 10.1 per cent to 424 1/2 p.

Moody 's puts Tesco under review after profit warning
Credit rating
Moody 's , the credit rating agency , has placed Tesco 's A3 long-term senior unsecured rating under review for possible downgrade , following the retailer 's shock profit warning last week .
Moody 's said yesterday that the review followed Tesco 's weak performance in its home market over the crucial Christmas and new year trading period , and the warning that underlying profits in the 2012-13 financial year would be lower than expected .
" The company 's recent investment in price promotions has not had the anticipated impact on volume growth .
" More significantly , however , Moody 's believes that the company 's revised forecast for profit growth suggests that the credit metrics may not improve to the extent that had previously been expected for the A3 rating and stable outlook , " the rating agency said yesterday .
However , it said that , more positively , Tesco had not altered its year-end net debt forecast of pound(s)6.4bn , while capital expenditure could be lowered through Tesco curbing its expansion plans , primarily through out of town hypermarkets .
Last week , Tesco issued its first profit warning for 20 years after poor trading in its domestic market .
However , it was given a fillip on Thursday when Warren Buffett , the billionaire US investor , spent pound(s)500m raising his stake in the retailer to more than 5 per cent .

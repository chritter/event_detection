Vodafone misses the rally because of trepidation about its results LONDON
Vodafone Group failed to join yesterday 's powerful rally that saw the FTSE 100 register its biggest one-day points gain since March 2003 and in the process recoup all and more of Monday 's losses .
After heavy trading , shares in the mobile phone operator closed 1 per cent cheaper at 116 3/4p on fears that next week 's results could disappoint .
Amid the boardroom wrangles and speculation about the future of Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture , the City seems to have lost track of the fact that trading at Vodafone has been tough .

" Part of Vodafone 's guidance is to outperform its competitors and currently this is not being done in key markets .
To stabilise market share loss , Vodafone may need to sacrifice margin , " said Merrill Lynch after reducing its 2006-07 earnings per share forecast by 4-5 per cent .
Traders said that yesterday 's poor performance from Vodafone also reflected comments made by Doreen Toben , the chief financial officer of Verizon Communications , who told delegates at a Morgan Stanley conference that she did not anticipate any deal with Vodafone in the near future .
In the wider market , volatility continued to be the name of the game .
Confused City traders were left scratching their heads as the FTSE 100 bounced back from Monday 's five-month low to close 146 points , or 2,64 per cent , higher at 5,678.7 - its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 2003 .
Elsewhere , the FTSE 250 , which suffered its biggest one-day points fall ever on Monday , surged 405.7 points , or 4.6 per cent to 9,234.3 - its biggest one-day points gain on record .
In spite of the rally , the mood in the City remains nervous .
" I do n't think anyone believes we are out of the woods yet or that this was anything more than a dead cat bounce , " commented one trader .

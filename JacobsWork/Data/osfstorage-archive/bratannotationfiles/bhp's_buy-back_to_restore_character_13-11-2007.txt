BHP 's buy-back to restore character
BHP Billiton 's plan to conduct a Dollars 30bn ( Pounds 14.4bn ) share buy-back if its Rio Tinto takeover is successful is designed to preserve the company 's Australian character and take advantage of tax credits .
Rio Tinto 's shareholder base is skewed to the UK as 72 per cent of its shareholders own UK-listed plc shares , with 28 per cent owning Australia-listed Limited shares .
BHP 's shareholder base has a more Australian bias , with 60 per cent made up of limited shares and 40 per cent made up of PLC shares .
A takeover of Rio by BHP would lift the proportion of PLC shares compared with Australian limited shares .
As 49 per cent of the combined assets by value would be in Australia , he said the company 's aim was to have roughly half of the group 's equity in Australian-listed limited shares .
This would let holders of the limited shares avoid paying tax on their dividends because of the Australian system of " franking credits " , said BHP .
Although the Dollars 30bn buy-back would apply " across the board " , BHP said the group would target UK-listed PLC shares to be bought and cancelled , reducing the size of the UK shareholder base .
Analysts have said it would also help BHP 's relations with the Australian government if the company was 50 per cent-owned by Australian investors .
BHP , which had very low gearing , plans to finance the Dollars 30bn buy-back with debt , which it said would make more efficient use of its balance sheet .
Some analysts said the promise of the buy-back was intended to boost BHP 's shares and make its offer of three BHP shares for one Rio share look more attractive .
" Today 's announcement was nothing more than an attempt to stop BHP 's share price falling , " said one analyst .
BHP 's UK shares fell 21p to Pounds 16.07.

BHP 's payout THE
Few chief executives can boast a name as upbeat as Chip Goodyear's .
The man who runs BHP Billiton lives up to his moniker : he has just unveiled the biggest half-year profit ever for an Australian company - BHP is listed in London and Sydney - and the mining sector 's largest share buy-back programme .
The buy-back sends a message of confidence - Dollars 10bn is equivalent to9 per cent of BHP 's market capitalisation .
On current forecasts , BHP can certainly afford it .
Societe Generale estimates BHP will generate operating cash flow of almost Dollars 40bn for the three years to June 2009 .
Take off Dollars 24bn for capital expenditure and regular dividends and the Dollars 16bn left is enough to fund the Dollars 10bn buy-back and pay off most of the group 's current net debt .
Mr Goodyear , who is leaving at the end of the year , will go out on a high .
BHP 's solid finances and diversity of activities engender stability .
Meanwhile , new oil projects and uranium should provide growth .
BHP has enjoyed a windfall in recent years as commodity prices have exploded .
Fear that this can not last , however , is the reason BHP 's shares have been steadily derated since 2004 : those listed in London now trade at less than nine times June 2007 earnings .
Last year , BHP 's shares went nowhere while rivals Xstrata and Anglo American performed rather better on the back of merger activity and restructuring .
In that context , big cash payouts are one way of restoring some momentum , especially with the likes of copper and oil having cooled off recently .
Virtually all of the 37 per cent year-on-year increase in BHP 's earnings before interest and tax for the six months to December came from price increases .
Even the most unabashed optimist must recognise the potential for commodity prices to put a damper on things .

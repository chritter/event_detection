Weak revenues prompt Vodafone to heighten cost-cutting efforts
Chief likely to raise pound(s)1bn reduction target ; Revenues hit by curbed spending on mobiles
Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , yesterday signalled that he was likely to extend the company 's cost-cutting plans beyond an existing pound(s)1bn programme .
His willingness to raise the pound(s)1bn target came after Vodafone 's 2008-09 results highlighted revenue weakness .
Vodafone reported a 15.6 per cent rise in revenue to pound(s)41bn for the year to March 31 and a 16.7 per cent increase in operating profit before one-off items to pound(s)11.8bn.
But the performance was largely driven by exchange rate movements , led by the euro 's strength against sterling .
On an underlying basis , revenue fell 0.4 per cent as consumers in western and emerging markets spent less on their mobile phones .
Pre-tax profit fell 53.5 per cent to pound(s)4.2bn , mainly because of pound(s)5.9bn of impairment charges largely relating to Vodafone 's underperforming Spanish and Turkish businesses .
Vodafone 's shares closed down almost 4 per cent at 122.4p.
Mr Colao announced that he was accelerating the plans to cut operating expenses by pound(s)1bn by March 2011 .
He said pound(s)650m of savings would be achieved by March 2010 compared with previous plans of pound(s)500m .
Mr Colao then went further , hinting that he could push cost-cutting beyond the pound(s)1bn target at Vodafone 's half-year results for 2009-10 in November .
" We are looking at ways of expanding the pound(s)1bn , " he said .
" We will come back in November on the expansion of the pound(s)1bn .
For the time being , it is an -acceleration . "
For the first time in a set of full-year results , underlying revenue fell at Vodafone 's European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of sales .
Vodafone met its target on free cash flow - broadly defined as cash from operating activities minus capital spending , and its main performance metric - by generating pound(s)5.7bn in 2008-09 .
The full-year dividend rose 3.5 per cent to 7.77p.
Basic earnings per share fell 53.5 per cent to 5.81p.
Vodafone gave no revenue guidance for 2009-10 and said adjusted operating profit - excluding one-off items such as impairment charges - should at best match 2008-09 .
Operating profit should be pound(s)11bn-11.8bn in 2009-10 .
Free cash flow should be pound(s)6bn-6.5bn.

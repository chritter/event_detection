Barclays should beware of a merger mismatch
The lessons of Absa for an ABN deal
If the outcome of Barclays ' acquisition of Absa is as " discouraging " as South Africa 's central bank governor claims , then it is the kind of profitable setback that John Varley , Barclays ' chief executive , will long for if he takes over ABN Amro - at least judging from his public pronouncements on the deal .
Last month , he announced that Absa , in the first full year since the 2005 purchase , was " performing well ahead of our acquisition business case " and that total savings from the transaction were " well ahead of plan " .
Yet in Johannesburg , according to Tito Mboweni , the Afrikaaners and the Brits ca n't even agree whether to start their meetings at 7am or 9am .
There may be a political subtext to Mr Mboweni 's comments but if there is a cultural mismatch , Barclays should beware .
In a recent survey by Hay Group , a consultancy , and the Sorbonne , European business leaders involved in mergers and acquisitions rued their failure to take human and cultural factors into account when doing deals .
A fifth of them said the early months after the merger were a " culture shock " and a further 16 per cent said it was more like " trench warfare " .
Barclays has good reason to be careful about declaring " mission accomplished " at Absa .
It bears the scars of the Woolwich takeover in 2000 , which it now concedes was not integrated quickly enough .
Spookily , in February 2002 , Barclays pointed out that the Woolwich deal had beaten its key integration synergy targets in its first full year in the group .
Barclays says it learnt from the Woolwich experience , but suddenly it makes even more sense that Mr Varley is falling over himself to accommodate the political and cultural foibles of his prospective fellow executives at ABN Amro .

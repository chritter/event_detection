BAT tests the market for snus

British American Tobacco is to test market snus , a form of smokeless tobacco , in Sweden and South Africa using two of its biggest brands .

Snus are small tobacco filled sachets , resembling miniature teabags , that are placed under the lip .

Similar products are popular in Sweden , with almost 20 per cent of adults using them regularly . 
Some believe that they are behind Sweden 's low adult lung cancer rates .

The products are virtually unknown in South Africa , but BAT has a 90 per cent share of the market , making the country an ideal test base . 
BAT will be selling snus in both countries under its Lucky Strike and Peter Stuyvesant brands .

Chris Proctor , head of science and regulation at BAT , said that the launch had been in response to the group listening to the concerns of public health officials about cigarettes .

The snus will be sold in 241 outlets in Johannesburg , and 300 in Stockholm . 
If the product proves successful after a year 's trial BAT intends rolling it out to more cities and countries .

But any expansion would have to be outside of the EU , where snus are banned , except for in Sweden .

Mr Proctor said that while he believed that the EU 's decision to ban snus was wrong , the group had no intention of arguing for a relaxation or overturning of the ruling at this point .

However , any repeal of the ban would leave BAT ahead of the market , given the absence of other big name brands in the market .

Deborah Arnott , director of Action on Smoking and Health in the UK , conceded that smokeless tobacco products were less harmful than combustible products .

But she accused tobacco companies of using reduced harm products as a way for them to " find a way back in from the cold " .

Vodafone
Know that feeling when the crackling phone connection clears and the caller no longer seems to be oceans deep ?
Vodafone 's full-year earnings yesterday were like that .
At first sight , the numbers were hardly cause for celebration .
Underlying revenues from phone services were down more than 4 per cent year-on-year in the final three months to March , the weakest quarterly result to date .
But this was no worse than markets feared .
The UK and Germany were particularly poor but were offset by better than expected growth outside Europe .
Moreover , a nadir may have been reached .
Easter timing and leap year effects will now unwind and comparisons ease .
Come late 2013-14 , regulatory-related pricing pressures should also lessen .
Ahead of mobile termination rate cuts , last year 's underlying service revenues would have been flat and while such cuts may knock another 2 percentage points off service revenue growth this year the impact should reduce sharply in 2014/15 .
So , with Vodafone looking to take pound(s)300m out of European operating expenses this year and seeing good growth in data usage , executives are projecting a 2013/14 operating profit of pound(s)12bn-pound(s)12.8bn.
That implies a slight improvement and should be eminently do-able .
For investors , little changes .
The latest pound(s)2.1bn payout from Verizon Wireless is kept to pay for spectrum .
But dividends are pledged to stay at current levels , giving a 5.5 per cent yield .
If Vodafone fancies acquisitions , net debt is pound(s)27bn , just twice earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , and executives say they could accept a rating downgrade for the right deal .
As for the relationship with Verizon , that may be a work in progress .
On an earnings basis , Vodafone shares are no steal .
But speculation , and sum-of-the-parts valuations , should underpin them .

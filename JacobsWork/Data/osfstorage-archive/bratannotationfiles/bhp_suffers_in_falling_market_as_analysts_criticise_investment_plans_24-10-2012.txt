BHP suffers in falling market as analysts criticise investment plans
london
The London market 's sharpest fall in nearly a month left BHP Billiton a casualty as analysts criticised its investment plans .
Development of BHP 's flagship Jansen potash project in Canada would be the worst option for shareholders , according to BMO Capital Markets .
The potash mine , potentially the world 's biggest , would cost $14bn to bring into production by 2017 .
But the world would not need more potash production for at least another decade and prices would have to rise by about 40 per cent to make the plant economic , BMO estimated .
" We believe the best decision for BHP is not to build or buy its way into the potash industry , and instead return cash to shareholders , " the broker said .
" However , we expect BHP will not go down this route . "
The second-best option for BHP shareholders would be for the company to shelve Jansen and buy Mosaic , the $22.4bn-valued US potash miner , BMO said .
However , Mosaic can not sell itself before May 2013 under terms of its divorce from Cargill , its former majority shareholder .
BHP closed 2.4 per cent lower at pound(s)19.82 , matching the wider mining sector as commodity indices turned negative for the year .
The FTSE 100 dropped 1.4 per cent or 85 points to 5,797.91.
Kazakhmys slid 4.6 per cent to 721.5p , ENRC was down 3.8 per cent to 332.7p and Antofagasta retreated 3.4 per cent to pound(s)12.65.
Chemical makers and industrial companies were under pressure after profit warnings from 3M and Du Pont .
Johnson Matthey was down 2.3 per cent to pound(s)22.27 , Elementis lost 3.9 per cent to 218.7p and Croda International retreated 2.3 per cent to pound(s)22.60.
Kenmare Resources , a key supplier of titanium pigment to Du Pont , fell 7.7 per cent to 39.5p.
As well as a downturn in demand , Du Pont was said to be suffering due to paint makers diluting their pigment with lower-quality Chinese feedstock that was finding its way on to the US market .
Admiral , the car insurer , lost 3.6 per cent to pound(s)11.06 after data from the AA showed UK premium rates continued to soften over the past three months .
Newly floated Direct Line slipped 1.9 per cent to 189.3p after Nomura started coverage with a " reduce " rating and 174p target - a penny below its flotation price .
Direct Line 's strong market position was already reflected in its valuation and , while restructuring would release additional value , investors will need to wait for results to gain confidence in the story .
Chemring fell 9.1 per cent to 314.9p as the exit of its chief executive raised fears that Carlyle would walk away from talks to buy the flare maker .
A profit warning carried Mulberry 23.8 per cent lower at pound(s)10.06 , with the handbag maker blaming tougher overseas markets and the cost of reining in its wholesale distributors .
In response , Burberry dropped 3.2 per cent to pound(s)11.34.
Burberry has already announced sales and margins for its interim results due November 7 .
However , analysts still expect the group to temper guidance for next financial year , if only to reflect the cost of bringing its perfumes brands in house .
" Buy " advice from UBS helped N Brown , the catalogue retailer , rise 2 per cent to 324.4p.
" The sticking point for many investors remains the credit offering , which accounts for 28 per cent of sales and an estimated 42 per cent of the gross profit , " UBS said .
" We estimate the current default rate at circa 10 per cent of sales and in broad terms this can rise as high as 20 per cent before the process becomes unprofitable . "
Housebuilder Redrow slid 0.5 per cent to 154.4p even after Toscafund said it had raised its stake to more than 14 per cent with the purchase of 800,000 shares .
Leading the gainers , Arm Holdings jumped 7.7 per cent to 640p after its quarterly earnings beat consensus expectations .
In-line results lifted Virgin Media 2.6 per cent to pound(s)20.91 , with the cable company 's customer additions levels of churn better than forecast .
Credit checker Experian rose 3.8 per cent to pound(s)10.87 after buying out nearly all minorities of its fastgrowing Brazilian business .
Analysts saw the deal boosting 2014 earnings by about 7 per cent .
Ophir Energy rose 0.7 per cent to 581p as it hosted an analyst meeting to set out its 2013 development programme .
Following a 100 per cent hit rate this year , Ophir said it had identified new prospects in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea and was targeting up to 15 highimpact wells for 2013 .

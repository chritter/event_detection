Analyst John-Paul Crutchley told clients that , by 2015 , Barclays would be able to have spun off its retail operations if required .
" If full ringfencing is eventually introduced in the UK , the time that Barclays will likely to have before implementation would , we think , allow the group to effectively break itself up into its component businesses with lower exit costs , " he said .
" Alternatively , if an outcome closer to the status quo is maintained , there is significant potential upside in the stock anyway . "
Barclays closed 5.6 per cent higher at 180 1/4 p.

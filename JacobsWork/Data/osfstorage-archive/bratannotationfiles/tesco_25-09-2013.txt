Tesco
Clothes , coffee shops , online films , a bank and now tablet computers .
It is all a far cry from founder Jack Cohen 's market stall .
Tesco 's foray into tablets , via the pound(s)119 Hudl , will not be an easy win .
The likes of Acer , Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard sell devices at similar price points .
Even Microsoft has struggled to make an impact on the tablet market .
Why is Tesco getting involved ?
Hudl sales will make little impact on profits .
True , the market is growing .
According to Gartner , global tablet sales will more than double between now and 2017 .
Yet Tesco would have to sell over 5m Hudls a year to even reach 1 per cent of turnover .
Tesco says it will be profitable .
But analysts are unlikely to be overhauling their financial models .
What the Hudl does represent is an effort to find growth in the stagnant UK supermarket industry .
Tesco has cut back its UK store expansion plans and is being more selective overseas .
But growth will have to come from somewhere .
Hence the development of Tesco bank and the acquisition of online film and music businesses .
Hudl owners will be able to access all these services , as well as buy groceries , via a conveniently placed permanent button .
It is like a Tesco store in the palm of your hand .
By pricing it low , Tesco will be hoping to lure impoverished students and the like , who are the big grocery shoppers of the future .
In that respect , Tesco has little to lose and is right to be bold .
Failure would be embarrassing , but after the Fresh & Easy debacle and the horsemeat scandal the company is used to dealing with setbacks .
It will not say what it has spent on the project , but it is unlikely to be a large share of the annual pound(s)3bn capex bill .
The Hudl could , however , be troubling for established players such as HP and Lenovo .
If a Jack-of-all-trades like Tesco can successfully take them on in the tablet market , what are they bringing to the party ?

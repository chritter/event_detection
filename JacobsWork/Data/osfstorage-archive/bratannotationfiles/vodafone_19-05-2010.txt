Vodafone
Growth engines are all very well until they start to sputter .
There was back-slapping all round three years ago when Vodafone paid $11bn for a controlling stake in an Indian operator .
Yes , it was pricey , but only 13 per cent of India 's population had mobile phones and revenue growth was running at about 50 per cent .
How could it lose ?
Arun Sarin , chief executive , promised that return on invested capital would exceed the local cost of capital in five years .
That is not going to happen , as Vodafone 's pound(s)2.3bn writedown on its Indian business yesterday made clear .
Even though operators have been adding customers at a ferocious rate , the capricious government has allowed more than a dozen of them to set up shop and blocked market consolidation .
The ensuing price war has made India miserable for everyone ( except , of course , consumers ) .
The growth rate of Vodafone 's Indian revenue , which accounts for less than a 10th of its total sales , slowed to 13 per cent last year and was less than half that in the final quarter .
Though Vodafone whinges , it is partly responsible : in 2007 it set up an infrastructure-sharing system that reduced costs but also lowered barriers to entry .
India 's allure remains .
The economy and population are growing rapidly and still only half have phones .
But toughing it out will be expensive .
Prices in third-generation spectrum auctions have shot through the roof and regulators want to charge retroactively for 2G spectrum too .
Vodafone is pinning its hopes on the market consolidating .
But it is not clear when the regulator will allow that , nor is it clear how many operators a market such as India 's will ultimately sustain - fewer than a dozen , certainly , but not necessarily the three to four common in Europe .
Finally , customers used to the cheapest phone calls in the world will not accept price rises willingly .
Spark plug , anyone ?

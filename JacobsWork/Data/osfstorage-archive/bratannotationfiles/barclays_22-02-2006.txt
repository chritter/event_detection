Barclays
For a bank that has had a tricky year in its core UK retail business , Barclays ' 15 per cent jump in full year pre-tax profits looks impressive .
This does not mean that all in the domestic garden is rosy : performance was shored up by strong earnings growth at Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm , and BGI , the global fund management business .
And , excluding its South African acquisition Absa , growth drops to
8 per cent .
But the impetus of these businesses gives credibility to the target of producing a 50:50 split between UK and international profits in the next three years , even without further acquisitions .
Building profitability at Barclays Capital while continuing to invest heavily is no mean feat , and reflects the clever product mix devised by its chief executive , Robert Diamond .
However , Barclays will not be able to rely on this level of profitability in a market downturn , and the business may have to prove it can shrink as nimbly as it has grown .
There is still the prospect that Barclays might sort out its UK retail business .
A rise in bad debt provisions helped depress earnings on Barclaycard , but that trend should slow this year .
Management also reports that operational problems that have contributed to its disappointing performance in mortgages have been tackled ( by bringing some outsourced processing in-house ) .
But investing further in the UK retail business while improving its cost/ income ratio represents a challenge .
Barclays still has to prove it can turn the corner in the UK .
But the hope that there will be scope to buy back shares later this year once Tier-one capital level , depleted by last year 's acquisition , has been restored to its target level of 7.25 per cent , should be enough to entice investors .

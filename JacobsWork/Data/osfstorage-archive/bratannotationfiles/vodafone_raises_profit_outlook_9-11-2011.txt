Vodafone raises profit outlook
Vodafone raised its outlook for full-year operating profit on the back of a stronger-than-expected performance in most of its largest -markets that more than countered a pound(s)450m ( $724m ) charge in its ailing Greek operations .
Vodafone expects full-year operating profit to come at the top end of its range outlined in May , partly because of a strong performance by Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which it has a 45 per cent stake .
Vodafone 's sales and operating profit were ahead of analysts ' expectations .
It reported pound(s)23.5bn of revenue for the half to September 30 , up 4.1 per cent

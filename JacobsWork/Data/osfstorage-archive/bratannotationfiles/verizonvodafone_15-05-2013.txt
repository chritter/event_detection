Verizon / Vodafone
Conspiracy theorists alert .
Verizon Wireless 's declaration of a $7bn dividend to be paid next month to its owners - Verizon Communications and the UK 's Vodafone - was subject yesterday to as many intricate interpretations as Elvis 's death .
Those buying into speculation that Verizon is poised to bid for the 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone seemed understandably deflated at first .
After all , if the ink is virtually dry on bid documents , why bother with this nicety ?
Moreover , for those convinced that Vodafone is being recalcitrant , the tactic of not paying dividends to push the UK group into negotiations had suddenly been tossed away .
But such spirits refused to be discouraged for long .
Of course , they quickly reasoned , this was an effort to take the issue of this year 's dividend off the table and allow negotiations over valuation between Verizon and Vodafone to progress unimpeded .
Not convinced ?
Try this instead .
The payout is an " olive branch " , oiling relations between the two boards .
Same conclusion : sale talks will proceed more smoothly .
It is all a bit of a nonsense .
Vodafone and Verizon may , indeed , try to resolve the relationship , but immediate pressure on the former is not obvious - nor are there many better alternative investments than Verizon Wireless at present .
Vis a vis its dividend declaration , a much simpler fact is that Verizon Communications will find it easier to maintain its own payout ( annual cost near $6bn ) if cash is pushed upstream from the now lowly geared mobile offshoot ( even if executives stressed recently that this was not a necessity ) .
What Vodafone does with the funds is more debatable .
It has paid out part of the Verizon Wireless dividend stream previously , but with a stock buyback already under way that looks less certain this time .
Some extra cash on Vodafone 's balance sheet would not go amiss .

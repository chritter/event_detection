BHP slides on Mosaic bid talk as FTSE 100 drops to fortnight-low
LONDON
BHP Billiton was among the fallers as the FTSE 100 slipped to a two-week low .
BHP shares eased 3 per cent to pound(s)18.33 amid renewed speculation it may bid for Mosaic , the second-largest potash producer .
Traders talked of a $75 offer price valuing the US-listed company at almost $35bn .
Mosaic becomes a takeover target next month once a lock-up agreement on shares held by parent company Cargill expires , according to analysts at CIBC .
They saw BHP as a likely bidder following last year 's failed $40bn approach for PotashCorp , Mosaic 's neighbour in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan .
BHP remains keen to invest in Saskatchewan , having spent $1.2bn developing its own potash mine in the province , CIBC said .
It also argued that Canadian politicians who last year blocked BHP 's PotashCorp bid would not hold the same leverage over any deal for Minnesota-based Mosaic .
The rest of the miners tracked metals prices lower with Kazakhmys losing 5 per cent to 830 1/2 p and Rio Tinto 3.9 per cent to pound(s)30.15.
Anglo American faded 4 per cent to pound(s)21.81 after a mixed production report .
Traders also noted talk that Anglo was working on acquisitions to compensate for last week 's loss of copper production to Codelco , Chile 's state-owned miner .
The fog surrounding eurozone crisis talks held back the wider market with banks and insurers weak .
The FTSE 100 was lower by 1.2 per cent , or 65.81 points , to 5,384.68.
Barclays was off 4.2 per cent at 172p , Lloyds Banking Group eased 4.5 per cent to 31 1/2 p and Aviva was weaker by 4.5 per cent to 324 1/2 p.
G4S led the blue-chip risers amid continued speculation that shareholders may block its pound(s)5.2bn deal to buy ISS , the office cleaning group .
G4S shares , which have fallen 14.6 per cent per cent since the deal was announced , rallied 3.2 per cent to 241p .
Parvus Asset Management said it would vote against the proposal after taking a 3.7 per cent stake in G4S , while several long-term holders were said to be unconvinced ahead of meetings with Nick Buckles , the security contractor 's chief executive .
The deal needs acceptance of at least 75 per cent of shares .
Next was up 2.9 per cent to pound(s)26.14 and Marks and Spencer put on 1.1 per cent to 332 1/2 p after firmer UK retail sales data than expected for September .
Share buy-back news saw Debenhams rise 7.7 per cent to 67 1/2 p.
Full-year results from the department store chain matched expectations and came with no guidance on current trading .
Home Retail Group rallied 3.9 per cent to 103 1/2 p , helped by a theory that the Argos owner might be a takeover target for Amazon .
Analysts had their doubts .
" We do n't see Home Retail as an acquisition target until margins , and cash generation , get really distressed , " said Liberum Securities .
" Argos margins are still higher than most peers and we see limited synergies with mass merchants , particularly in apparel .
Any acquirer would also have significant M&A risk in a Homebase exit and an appetite for pound(s)3bn of lease liabilities . "
Pace dived 13 per cent to 80p after its third profit warning of the year .
The set-top box maker blamed supply chain disruption caused by floods in Thailand , where its hard drive supplier Western Digital is based .
A downgrade to " underperform " from Credit Suisse sent Mondi , the paper maker , 7.1 per cent lower at 448 1/2 p.
The bank argued that the stock had outperformed peers in spite of sector-wide demand weakness and pricing pressures .
Power station owner Drax Group jumped 10.3 per cent to 529p after the UK government set out proposals to subsidise renewable generation from 2013 .
The move " may make Drax 's [ biomass ] conversion plans just about feasible " , said Investec .
Betfair was up 2.6 per cent to 745p .
Numis Securities said the betting exchange 's plans to launch a fixed-odds sportsbook next year could boost group profit by 50 per cent .
Among small caps , Mozambique-focused Cove Energy was up 8.6 per cent to 88p after Eni reported its biggest ever gas find in a neighbouring prospect .

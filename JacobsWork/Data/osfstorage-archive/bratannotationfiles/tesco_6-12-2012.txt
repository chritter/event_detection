Tesco
About time too .
Tesco 's decision to get out of the US ( or , in corporate-speak , launch a " strategic review " of the business ) is long overdue .
For a business that accounted for only 1 per cent of Tesco 's sales in the first half of the year it attracted a disproportionate amount of attention .
Tesco has little to show for the pound(s)1bn it has spent in the US , other than pound(s)800m of accumulated losses and a 200-store estate that struggled to attract shoppers .
Decision time was rapidly approaching .
Much of the investment to date has gone on overheads - supply chains , manufacturing bases , the lot .
And that infrastructure could cope with far more than 200 stores , so to keep the chain at the current size made little sense .
Credit Suisse had forecast that its Fresh & Easy US business would break even in 2014-2015 .
But even assuming 5 per cent revenue growth per year after that , and a 5.5 per cent operating margin , Fresh & Easy would not have reached the group 's 14.6 per cent return on capital target until 2034 .
Getting there faster would have required more investment in stores .
And Tesco is no longer in the mood to be a big spender .
With the core UK business struggling ( like-for-like sales in the UK fell 1.2 per cent in the third quarter ) , the company is becoming increasingly frugal and picking its targets far more carefully .
A sub-scale operation in a mature market no longer fits the bill .
As it is , Deutsche Bank says that an exit from the US will improve the group 's return on capital by 120 basis points .
The US distraction is not entirely out of the way - Tesco still has to find an exit route and deal with a possible write-off - but the decision to leave is a good start .
The challenge now is for the company to find other homes for its capital that are not only more attractive than the US in their own right , but will also keep the company growing despite its domestic troubles .

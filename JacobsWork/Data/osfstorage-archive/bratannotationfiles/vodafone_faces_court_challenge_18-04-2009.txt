Vodafone faces court challenge
Vodafone of the UK faces an unexpected hurdle in its plans to advance into Africa by spending $2.5bn to acquire control of South Africa 's biggest mobile phone company , after a trade union sought a court order to block the deal .
The world 's largest mobile operator by revenue said in October it planned to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom , its 50-50 joint venture with South Africa 's state-controlled Telkom .
But yesterday the Communication Workers Union said it would seek to prevent Telkom selling its shares at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday .
" We are not happy that the [ controlling ] stake is being sold to a foreign company , " Gallant Roberts , general secretary , told the Financial Times .
Vodacom 's subscribers across five African countries last year generated revenues of R48.2bn ( $5.4bn ) .
Telkom said it would oppose the union 's court application .
Vodafone declined to comment .

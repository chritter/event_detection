View of the Day - Yingxi Yu , Barclays Capital
Concerns that Chinese demand for commodities could slow after the Olympic Games should not be overdone , says Yingxi Yu at Barclays Capital .
" If anything , we see potential for demand growth in some sectors to pick up in the third quarter of the year and into the fourth quarter , " she says , noting the macroeconomic backdrop remains benign .
" There has been a clear shift from reliance on exports towards domestic demand .
As a result , industrial production , retail sales and fixed-asset investment have maintained robust expansions , the latter boosted by post- earthquake rebuilding . "
She says the temporary closure of factories in Beijing implies a possible ramping up in operations when they restart .
For certain markets , such as copper and aluminium , she believes consumption data have been artificially depressed by destocking .
" In oil , government policies have been mainly directed at ensuring supply during the Olympics month .
Strong import growth suggests the supply system is operating above minimum inventory requirements , but we see no evidence of inventory building on the scale of the observed demand increase ; hence there is unlikely to be a significant overhang , especially when about 1m vehicles return to the roads after the Games .
" Large-scale investments are still much-needed in parts of the country such as Shanghai , as it begins in earnest its preparations for the 2010 World Expo . "

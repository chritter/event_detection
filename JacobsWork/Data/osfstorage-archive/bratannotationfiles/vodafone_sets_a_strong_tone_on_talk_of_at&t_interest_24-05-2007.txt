Vodafone sets a strong tone on talk of AT&T interest
By NEIL HUME and ROBERT ORR
Turnover in Vodafone topped 1.3bn shares yesterday as traders piled in amid rumours of predatory interest from a US rival .
Shares in the mobile phone operator closed 3.7 per cent higher at 149.9p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - on rumours that it could be a takeover target for AT&T .
Sector watchers said the Dollars 250bn US telecoms company was the only industry player big enough to buy Vodafone and the only one that would not run into regulatory problems .
AT&T recently tried to break into Europe when it joined forces with America Movil of Mexico to try and buy a large stake in Telecom Italia .
However , others were sceptical .
They said the timing of the rumour looked odd as AT&T 's chief executive , Ed Whitacre , steps down next month .
Dealers reckoned the rise had been exacerbated by short sellers buying back positions .
Just over 6 per cent of Vodafone 's issued share capital is currently on loan .
Based on average daily trading volumes , that would take a week and half to buy back .
Dealers also pointed out that there had been no nasty shocks in the telecoms reporting season and this was a good sign as Vodafone publishes annual results on Tuesday .
Vodafone 's strong performance , which was mirrored in shares of telecoms stocks across Europe , helped the FTSE 100 close 9.8 points , or 0.2 per cent , higher at 6,616.4.
Elsewhere , the FTSE 250 added 43.9 points , or 0.4 per cent , to close at 12,220.2.
Vodafone was not the only telecoms group on the move .
BT rose 2.8 per cent to 326 1/2p while Cable & Wireless gained 2.7 per cent to 186.7p amid talk today 's full year results would impress , with the company meeting forecasts and providing strong guidance for 2008 , particularly in the UK .
Pennon Group , the owner of South West Water , remained in the speculative spotlight .
Its shares climbed 5.2 per cent to 691p amid talk that it could be a takeover target for Aguas de Barcelona , the Spanish utility company controlled by Suez and La Caxia .
Traders said there was some logic behind the rumour as Aguas owns Bristol Water .
However , they cautioned that any offer was unlikely to be made before Pennon files half-year results next Thursday .
In the same sector , Kelda , which owns Yorkshire Water , added 3 per cent to Pounds 10.01 1/2p amid talk that it too could be a takeover target .
The tittle tattle in the market yesterday was that Kelda is being stalked by a foreign financial buyer .
On a less speculative tack , Rexam , the world 's biggest maker of drinks cans , added 2.9 per cent to 535p as short sellers closed positions after ABN Amro upgraded to " buy " .
The Dutch broker said Rexam was trading on an undemanding price / earnings multiple .
Elsewhere , Hammerson added 1.3 per cent to Pounds 16 on talk it could be a takeover target for British Land , up 2.1 per cent to Pounds 14.56 , while Compass Group improved 1.1 per cent to 381 3/4p after Citigroup reiterated its " buy " recommendation .
The broker said shares in the contract caterer could reach 500p if it were able to improve its capital expenditure / sales ratio .
BHP Billiton firmed 0.6 per cent to Pounds 12.13 amid suggestions that it might make a ' White Knight ' bid for Alcan , the Canadian metals company currently fighting a hostile bid from US rival Alcoa .
On the downside , Bradford & Bingley dipped 1.8 per cent to 447p after ABN Amro warned that a trading update , due on June 21 , could disappoint and result in earnings downgrades .
The broker said B&B shares could fall to 400p .
Sugar producer Tate & Lyle dropped 6.2 per cent to 605p after warning of modest profits growth from its zero calorie sweetener Splenda .
Enodis , the catering equipment maker , was among the top performers in the FTSE 250 .
Its shares moved up 5.3 per cent to 208 3/4p after Credit Suisse upgraded to " outperfrom " and set a 250p target price .
London Stock Exchange , off 0.6 per cent to Pounds 13.49 , was in focus as a block of 11.2m shares , or 5.5 per cent of the company , changed hands .
But dealers dismissed talk of stake building , noting that LSE trade was part of a large derivatives transaction .

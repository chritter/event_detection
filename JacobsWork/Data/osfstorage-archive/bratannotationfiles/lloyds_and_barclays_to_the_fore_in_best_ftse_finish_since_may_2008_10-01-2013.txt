Lloyds and Barclays to the fore in best FTSE finish since May 2008
LONDON
Lloyds Banking Group led the way yesterday as gains for financial stocks helped the FTSE 100 to a four-and-a-half-year high .
UBS argued that Lloyds was the best way to play a return to normality for the banks , which will see the threat of onerous regulation reduced along with a revival in new lending .
" We believe UK domestic banking holds out the realistic prospect of 14 per cent returns on equity for shareholders , with 2013 finally seeing a rapid fade in legacy costs in all their forms , " it said .
" Lloyds is clearly going to deliver rising margins , falling costs and falling provisions which should provide a very strong upswing to profitability and EPS momentum over the next few years , " said UBS .
It set a 60p target on Lloyds shares , which rose 4.9 per cent to 53.4p , the highest since May 2011 .
Royal Bank of Scotland followed , up 3.8 per cent to 349.9p , while Barclays took on 2.6 per cent to 294.8p.
Standard Chartered rose 3.2 per cent to pound(s)16.58 , with Merrill Lynch and SocGen both issuing " buy " advice .
The FTSE 100 ended 0.7 per cent higher at 6,098.65 , a gain of 45.02 points .
It was the best finish for the index since May 2008 .
Engineer Meggitt was up 3.8 per cent to 425p on an upgrade to " buy " from Merrill Lynch .
Self-help measures in combination with recovering demand for civil aviation and business jets this year should drive a re-rating , in spite of the uncertain outlook for defence spending , Merrill said .
Merrill was also positive on the outlook for fellow engineer GKN , which added 1.7 per cent to 235.3p.
A " buy " recommendation on valuation grounds from Goldman Sachs lifted John Wood Group , the rig services company , by 3.3 per cent to 774p .
ITV edged up 0.6 per cent to 109.3p on suggestions that its advertising sales in January had jumped by between 11 and 15 per cent , thanks largely to a contract renewal dispute between Channel 4 and media buyer Group M .
Miners found support after Alcoa 's results pointed to rising global demand .
Kazakhmys added 2.4 per cent to 825.5p , while Glencore added 2.2 per cent to 385.2p and Xstrata was up 2.1 per cent to pound(s)11.55.
Merrill Lynch speculated that Glencore should receive regulatory approvals for its Xstrata bid by mid-January so could complete the buyout within the month .
Gold miner Centamin jumped 13.1 per cent to 50p after its 2012 production beat previous guidance .
Investors had been expecting a shortfall following Centamin 's suspension of operations last month .
African Barrick Gold rallied 7.9 per cent to 380p , having slumped 21 per cent on Monday after its owner abandoned sale talks .
Merrill Lynch argued that the sell-off had been overdone , with African Barrick shares " cheap " at 0.8 times net present value .
But house broker JPMorgan Cazenove argued that African Barrick still did not merit a " buy " , given weak operational results during the takeover period and a more conservative production outlook .
Leading the blue-chip fallers , J Sainsbury reversed a rally on Monday to fade 2.9 per cent to 329.2p.
Its Christmas update showed trading had been as difficult as expected .
Aviva eased 2.2 per cent to 373.7p after the sale of its Delta Lloyd stake failed to ease concerns about a dividend cut .
The insurer raised pound(s)353m by selling its 19.4 per cent stake at a narrow discount to the market price .
Grafton , the Irish building materials group , rose 6.8 per cent to EUR4.18 after saying its 2012 earnings would beat market expectations .
The update helped lift larger peer Travis Perkins by 4.4 per cent to pound(s)11.67 , with further support from " buy " advice from Liberum Capital .

Jury still out on Unilever 's first-quarter sales recovery

Unilever bucked its recent depressing trend with a surprise increase in underlying sales growth during the first quarter .

Shares in the Anglo-Dutch company , whose brands include Dove soap and Lipton tea , rose 13 1/2p to 529p .

Analysts and investors had been wary of poor first-quarter results from Unilever , which has struggled with declining sales in recent years .

The company 's executives acknowledged that much work remained to improve its market share against competitors such as Procter & Gamble of the US .

But Unilever said its competitive position had improved over the past six months , with sales growing 2 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier , excluding the impact of extra trading days .

Most of the increase was down to healthy sales of Unilever products in emerging markets . 
In Asia and Africa , the company 's underlying sales rose by some 7 per cent .

Europe remained weak even as the company cut prices to try and improve its competitive position , and sales dropped 2 per cent . 
Sales rose 4 per cent in the Americas .

Pre-tax profit was up 8.5 per cent to Euros 1.28bn ( Pounds 867m ) .

Analysts said it is too early to tell whether the first-quarter rise in underlying sales growth would be sustained .

" The jury surely still has to be out , " said analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston , the investment bank .

Unilever refused to give precise information on exactly how much it is spending on advertising and promotions ( A&P ) .

Analysts stressed that it is important to know how much money the company is spending on A&P because it affects the bottom line .

Relatively low investment in A&P may be boosting Unilever 's profit margins , one analyst said .

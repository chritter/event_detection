Rio hits record high as BHP bid battle poised to intensify
By NEIL HUME and ROBERT ORR
Rio Tinto closed at a record high yesterday as rumours swirled that rival BHP Billiton was set to raise its hostile offer .
Rio rose 6 per cent to Pounds 63.67 amid talk BHP would increase the exchange ratio of its bid to four BHP shares for every one Rio share .
BHP , which rose 5.4 per cent to Pounds 18.65 , would then seek to get a recommendation from Rio before regulators in Europe start their investigation into the deal .
This is due to commence later this month .
Traders said such a move might help smooth the regulatory process .
However , most reckoned a trigger - such as further Chinese stakebuilding in Rio - would be needed before BHP raised its offer .
They also noted that any increase in the share exchange ratio above 3.7:1 would leave the majority of BHP shares trading in London rather than Australia .
All told , it was good day for the mining sector as commodity prices such as copper came close to record highs .
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 13.40 while Antofagasta added 4 per cent to 798p .
Lonmin , the platinum producer , added 5.4 per cent to Pounds 32.74 ahead of next week 's second-quarter production report .
Traders noted that Lonmin had significantly underperformed peers Aquarius Platinum and South Africa 's Impala Platinum since the start of the year .
However , Aquarius slipped 4.2 per cent to 814 1/2p after raising Dollars 366m through a placing of new shares at 800p .
The mining company will use the cash to help buy back the 8.4 per cent stake owned by Impala .
In the wider market , leading shares stormed higher following better-than expected results from JPMorgan Chase .
The FTSE 100 settled 139.3 points , or 2.4 per cent , higher , at 6,046.2.
The FTSE 250 rose 187 points , or 1.9 per cent , to 10,091.2.
However , trading volumes were light , with just 2.5bn shares changing hands .
Traders said this suggested that most of yesterday 's buying was done to close short positions .
Indeed , this was particularly evident in the banking sector , where shares in Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 7.6 per cent to 375p , Barclays rose 6.7 per cent to 479p and Alliance & Leicester climbed 6.8 per cent to 503p .
HBOS , the UK 's biggest mortgage lender , also made gains , rising 4.9 per cent to 539 1/2p .
Its shares were helped by a positive note from Cazenove .
" In our view , HBOS 's dividend payment is less at risk than others as the economy slows , " it said .
Carphone Warehouse recovered some of Tuesday 's 13 per cent drop .
Its shares rallied 4.8 per cent to 242p on talk that Best Buy , Carphone 's US joint venture partner , had taken advantage of the fall to increase its near 3 per cent holding .
Remaining on the speculative tack , drugmaker Shire firmed 0.4 per cent to 931p on renewed talk of a bid from Pfizer .
Traders reckoned a bid from AstraZeneca , 0.7 per cent higher at Pounds 21.36 , was more likely now that it had settled a patent dispute over top-selling ulcer treatment Nexium .
Of mid-caps , Findel , the home shopping and educational supplier group , gained 9.8 per cent to 444 1/4p after Kaupthing advised clients to buy .
Analyst Matthew McEachran said that , if concerns over earnings forecasts proved to be ill-founded , Findel shares could enjoy an " immediate and substantial " rebound .
Yell , the heavily indebted publisher of the Yellow Pages , added 4.4 per cent to 164 1/2p as Morgan Stanley retained its " overweight " recommendation and set a revised target price of 350p - 112 per cent above last night 's closing price .
The broker said it expected Yell to pay a final dividend of 11.4p and announce a major restructuring when it files full-year results on May 20 .
" Trading at 3.9 times prospective earnings , we believe the shares are already discounting a 1-for-1 rights issue , " it said .
Premier Foods , the debt laden maker of Branston Pickle , rose 2.6 per cent to 128 3/4p on rumours that it could be a takeover target for Kraft .
Traders were sceptical however .
Hardy Oil & Gas drifted 2.1 per cent to 741p amid talk directors had been selling stock .
Traders reckoned 750,000 shares had been offloaded at 726p yesterday .

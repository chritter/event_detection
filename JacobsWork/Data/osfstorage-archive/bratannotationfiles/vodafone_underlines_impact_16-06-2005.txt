Vodafone underlines impact
Vodafone was one of the first blue-chip companies to report the impact of international accounting standards and reveal one of the most substantial increases in net debt .
Restating its books for September last year , the mobile phone operator said that net debt of Pounds 8.7bn under UK accounting standards would rise by 27 per cent to Pounds 11.1bn under international accounting rules .
The increase was overlooked due to attention being focused on an end to goodwill amortisation that boosted Vodafone 's profit .
However , the higher debt levels did reflect accounting issues that many companies were facing - although Vodafone said the changes were largely cosmetic .
" What we 've got are presentational differences in our debt rather than a fundamental increase in net debt , " said an investor relations official .
More than Pounds 1bn of the rise was accounted for by new rules on " proportionate consolidation " , which required the group to account for its 77 per cent stake in an Italian joint venture .
Previously , the joint venture had appeared in the accounts as if it was 100 per cent owned but the new treatment meant Vodafone stopped recognising assets that effectively belonged to its partner , pushing net debt higher .
A further Pounds 880m rise in debt came from the reclassification of preference shares , which are branded as debt under IFRS .
The IAS 39 standard on financial instruments accounted for another Pounds 350m as the requirement to display liabilities at " fair value " captured a set of refinancing bonds .
Vodafone took great care to ensure investors were not unnerved by the changes .
" People had been aware of the preference share issue for a while but proportionate consolidation was a new concept for some , so it took a little more time to go through the mechanics , " said the official .

Lloyds and Barclays lead banks ' retreat as FTSE loses ground
LONDON
Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays led the fallers on Wednesday as the FTSE 100 took another lurch lower .
The banks retreated after reported comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble helped push yields on Spanish and Italian government bonds higher .
Concerns about the effectiveness of Europe 's future rescue fund led to Goldman Sachs to advise taking profits on the banks in the wake of last week 's rally in share prices from two-year lows .
" Doubts have started to creep back into the market , said Peter Oppenheimer , Goldman 's chief strategist .
" Given the prospects for ongoing deleveraging , domestic demand throughout much of the periphery of Europe is likely to remain weak , thereby constraining the prospects for loan growth for much of the sector , " he said .
" Concerns about capital raisings are also likely to remain high for some time , despite the relatively benign outcome of the stress tests . "
Lloyds lost 4.3 per cent to 43 1/4 p and Barclays closed 3.4 per cent weaker at 221p .
Royal Bank of Scotland fell 3.2 per cent to 35p .
Earnings from Santander also contributed to the nervousness , with the Spanish lender saying its UK net interest margin had deteriorated and asset quality was fragile .

Legal & General faded 2.8 per cent to 112p as insurers followed banks lower .
Exane BNP Paribas analyst Andy Hughes , a long-standing critic of L&G , argued that the stock was " 60 per cent more expensive than Standard Life " because its annuities business was being overvalued .
Setting a 102p target , he said the pound(s)25.6bn annuities portfolio should be valued only at book value rather than based on future earnings or cash flow .
Standard Life closed 2.3 per cent weaker at 197 1/2 p.
Software companies outperformed .
Autonomy gained 3.9 per cent to pound(s)17.20 on in-line earnings and confident guidance , while Sage Group was up 1.6 per cent to 281 1/2 p. on a reassuring trading statement .

Earnings , though up 180 per cent , were slightly weaker than the consensus forecasts , while a working capital outflow meant the group 's cash balances unexpectedly reduced by pound(s)5.3m.
Spirent Communications , the maker of network testing equipment , dropped 6.2 per cent to 126 3/4 p after profit warnings from Juniper Networks and Tellabs .
The latter company , a competitor of Spirent , said it was cutting 10 per cent of its workforce after North American demand slumped by 46 per cent .

Laird had earlier set out new growth targets and raised its 2011 dividend by 27 per cent .
Provident Financial rose 8.4 per cent to pound(s)11.15 on short covering after interim earnings from the subprime money lender were better than feared .
Among small-caps , WSP Group was marked up by 2.7 per cent to 293 3/4 p after Liberum Capital said the engineering consultancy was a likely takeover target over the long term .
Typical deals suggested an exit price of between 511p and 660p , Liberum analyst Joe Brent said .

Unilever / Alberto Culver
Unilever is putting its money where its mouth isn't .
The global consumer goods company talks a lot about increasing its presence in emerging markets , which already account for half of sales .
But on Monday it agreed to spend $3.7bn on Alberto Culver , which mostly sells its shampoo and creams in the US and the UK - sluggish markets at best .
Unilever wants to beef up its market share in hair care .
Its target has enjoyed strong growth there , thanks to the salon-in-the-supermarket brand TRESemme .
Unilever 's personal care sector is also growing fast : sales rose 16 per cent in the first half of this year , about twice as fast as ice cream and home care .
The price is more salon than supermarket , at almost 15 times earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation for the past fiscal year to June .
Analysts reckon on at least $160m in annual cost synergies .
Add those to Alberto Culver 's expected $260m operating profit next year , take off tax , and earnings should rise by about $290m .
In other words , the acquisition will deliver an initial return of about 8 per cent , more or less in line with estimates for Unilever 's post-acquisition weighted average cost of capital .
Of course , the return could improve over time .
Unilever 's investors appear to be keen - the shares rose in a falling market .
Yet the question remains : why did n't Unilever spend its money in emerging markets where populations , incomes and sales are rising so quickly ?
Perhaps because it is hard to spend $4bn in the developing world well - few large and attractive acquisition targets are left .
Blowing the cash on advertising would just spark a competitive response , not make people richer faster .
This unimaginative acquisition shows that even with a strong balance sheet and a market capitalisation of about $85bn , the world is not your oyster .

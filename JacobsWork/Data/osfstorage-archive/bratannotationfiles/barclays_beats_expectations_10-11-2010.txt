Barclays beats expectations
Barclays stamped out rumours that it could issue fresh equity and presented better-than-expected third-quarter profits on Tuesday , pushing the bank 's share price up and closing the valuation gap with rivals .
Chris Lucas , finance director , said the new Basel III rules on bank capital would give it a core tier one capital ratio of 11.5 per cent by the end of 2013 .
His forecast factored in accumulated profits over the next three years offset by a 25 per cent , or pound(s)100bn ( $160bn ) , net jump in risk-weighted assets .
Although Mr Lucas cautioned that accelerating compliance with the whole of Basel III , which is to be phased in by 2019 , would cut the ratio back to 10.5 per cent , analysts said the bank 's capital position looked far stronger than had been feared .
Loan impairments dropped faster than expected , fuelled by a marked decline in losses on Barclays ' credit market exposure and some improvement in its troubled Spanish market .
The bank now expects a 30 per cent drop in bad loans this year , more than its previously anticipated 15-20 per cent .
Overall , Barclays posted a pre-tax profit of pound(s)327m for the third quarter , compared with pound(s)1.4bn a year earlier .
Stripping out charges relating to the value of its own debt , profit fell 28 per cent to pound(s)1.3bn.

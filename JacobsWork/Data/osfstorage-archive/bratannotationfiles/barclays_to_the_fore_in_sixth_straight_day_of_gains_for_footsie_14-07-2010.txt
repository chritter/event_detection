Barclays to the fore in sixth straight day of gains for Footsie
LONDON
A sixth straight gain yesterday pushed the FTSE 100 index to its sharpest re-bound in more than a year .
Barclays was among the top performers as analysts dismissed worries about an investment bank slowdown .
Risk aversion on sovereign debt concerns made for a weak second quarter at Barclays Capital , Morgan Stanley said .
It forecast underlying profit at the division to have halved in the second quarter as sales fell 17 per cent from the previous quarter to around pound(s)3.2bn.
But Barclays ' valuation remained " undemanding " at 0.85 times tangible book value , Morgan Stanley continued .
Based on normalised earnings , it set a 400p price target .
Meanwhile , Sanford Bernstein argued that Barclays was a good option for investors wanting exposure to a rapid European recovery at reasonable risk .
While the sovereign debt crisis was likely to get worse before it got better , the prospect of a eurozone collapse might force Germany to consider a scheme offering mutual support for all members , the broker argued .
Such a framework would lead banks including Barclays to move sharply higher .
Barclays rose 4.2 per cent to 312 1/2 p.
Since closing at 270 1/2 p on July 1 , it has risen more than 15 per cent .
The FTSE 100 has trodden a similar path , with the index yesterday rising 2 per cent or 104 points to 5,271.02.
It has risen 9.3 per cent in six days , its sharpest rally since April 2009 .
Miners rose on the back of better-than-expected res-ults from Alcoa , which showed improved aluminium demand across all end-markets except automotive .
Anglo American added 1.3 per cent to pound(s)24.14 and Antofagasta put on 3.4 per cent to 932 1/2 p.
BP rose 2.9 per cent to 410 1/4 p after Abu Dhabi said it was still considering making an investment .
But BP 's US-traded stock slipped after the close of London trade as rumours circulated that its plan to fit a containment cap on the Macondo oil leak had hit a snag .
Man Group rose 2.4 per cent to 221p amid speculation about predatory interest from a US bank .
One theory was that Man might be vulnerable if its deal to buy rival GLG Partners fell through .
Speculation about disposals helped lift Vodafone by 1.9 per cent to 146p .
MF Global analysts said Vodafone was likely to sell its French minority , SFR , to Vivendi for around pound(s)6.5bn before the end of the year .
That would strengthen Vodafone 's negotiating position with Verizon , its US partner , which would make a sale of its stake in their joint venture increasingly likely , MF said .
Johnson Matthey gained 3.6 per cent to pound(s)16.16 , with JPMorgan Cazenove recommending the stock ahead of results next week .
Product testing specialist Intertek added 4 per cent to pound(s)16.40 on the back of " buy " advice from Merrill Lynch , with the broker raising its target price to pound(s)16.40.
" Intertek remains our preferred play as a purer play on recovering consumer and oil testing markets , " ML said in a sector review .
A rm Holdings rose 3.3 per cent to 309p , helped by Goldman Sachs research naming the chip designer among the " primary winners " from Apple 's Ipad launch .
Results due overnight from Intel also gave traders an excuse to revisit speculation that Arm could be a takeover target .
Compass Group rose 2.2 per cent to 552 1/2 p after Citigroup started coverage with a " buy " rating based on its " defensive growth " outside Europe and higher margins than peer Sodexo .
British American Tobacco gained 2.6 per cent to pound(s)22.77 after Goldman Sachs turned positive on valuation grounds , while Imperial Tobacco rose 2.6 per cent to pound(s)19.37 ahead of a trading update next week .
Credit Suisse said it was expecting good news .

HSBC pays Dollars 1.1bn to double stake in Ping An of China

HSBC is to double its stake in Ping An , China 's second-largest life assurer , by buying the 10 per cent held by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for Dollars 1.1bn ( Pounds 580m ) in the biggest foreign investment in a Chinese insurer .

The deal , at nearly twice the Dollars 600m paid by HSBC for its first 10 per cent , will speed HSBC 's entry into China 's fast-growing insurance market by giving it access to Ping An 's 20m policy holders and 250,000 sales agents . 
China 's insurance market is forecast to double in value from Dollars 50bn in the next three years .

The transaction will yield a 14-fold return on the original investment made by the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - one of the largest windfalls earned by foreign investors in a Chinese company . 
The two US investment banks bought a combined 12.7 per cent stake in Ping An for about Dollars 70m in 1994 - one of the first private equity investments in a Chinese company . 
Their holding was reduced to about 10 per cent when the Chinese insurer sold shares on the Hong Kong market in a Dollars 1.8bn initial public offering last year . 
HSBC bought its first 10 per cent stake in 2002 . 
Under the deal announced yesterday , HSBC will buy a 9.91 per cent stake for HKDollars 13.2 a share - a 9 per cent premium to Friday 's closing price - for a total of HKDollars 8.1bn . 
Shares in Ping An yesterday rose 5 per cent to close at HKDollars 12.75 - 23 per cent higher than the HKDollars 10.33 IPO price .

HSBC 's total Dollars 1.7bn investment dwarfs the Dollars 300m paid by American International Group for a 9.9 per cent stake in PICC , the general insurer , in 2003 . 
Under Chinese rules , foreign investors can own up to 19.9 per cent of a domestic insurer 's shares .

Sir John Bond , HSBC chairman , said it was " optimistic about the long-term prospects of the insurance industry in mainland China and believes Ping An is well positioned to benefit from the sector's development " .

Analysts predicted that HSBC would form a joint venture to develop and sell insurance products with Ping An , which controls about 17 per cent of China 's life assurance market . 
The two companies jointly acquired Ping An Bank in 2003 .

In the first quarter of this year , AIG lost its top spot as China 's largest overseas insurer for the first time since 1992 to Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali .

Barclays ' cash call
Barclays said this week that it plans to raise pound(s)5.8bn via a rights issue in September , writes Jonathan Eley .
It needs the money in order to comply with new regulations on capital and leverage .
Rights issues give existing shareholders the opportunity to buy new shares in proportion to their existing holdings , usually at a discounted price .
If they do not wish to take up their rights , they can sell them to someone else through a stockbroker .
Barclays will offer one new share for every four existing ones at 185p a share , a 40 per cent discount to the market price before the announcement .
Further details will be made available in September .
Dividends will be held in respect of this financial year , so shareholders should receive a 1p per share interim dividend in September , another 1p in early December and a 3.5p final dividend next March .
Thereafter , dividends will be 40-50 per cent of post-tax earnings - compared to 15-20 per cent now .
Analysts were surprised by the size of the rights issue , but said it would put the bank on a firmer footing .
" We see the investment case of Barclays , once the rights issue has subsided , as attractive , " said Ed Salvesen at Brewin Dolphin , who advises taking up the rights .
Separately , Lloyds Banking Group said it was in talks with regulators about restarting dividends , which were suspended after it sought state aid in 2009 .

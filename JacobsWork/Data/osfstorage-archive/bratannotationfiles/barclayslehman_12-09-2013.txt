Barclays / Lehman
At Barclays , the adaynniversary of the death of Lehman Brothers is an occasion for a toast , not revisiting old regrets .
For most of us , Lehman 's demise marks the moment when a banking brush fire exploded into an out-of-control economic inferno .
But with the fire came a fire sale , and Barclays was flush enough , and clever enough , to pull out its cheque book .
With its recent difficulties ( Libor scandal , restructuring ) , it is easy to forget how five years ago , Barclays took the left over pieces of Lehman and turned itself into an investment banking powerhouse .
Barclays spent just $250m for the Lehman investment banking and capital markets businesses ( it spent another $1.5bn for the corporate headquarters and two data centres , all of which have surely appreciated too ) .
In 2007 , the Lehman debt and equity underwriting and merger advice business alone generated $4bn in revenue , ranking it ninth globally , according to Dealogic .
Lehman lacked the prestige and dominance of Goldman Sachs , but recall that Barclays was an afterthought in these businesses , particularly in the US .
2008 was a good year to snap up flailing banks , but Bear Stearns was a minnow and Bank of America was hot for Merrill Lynch ( BofA chief executive Ken Lewis , regrettably , bought all of Merrill 's assets and assumed all its liabilities rather than waiting for it to go belly up and picking up the choicest bits ) .
In 2012 , Barclays was eighth in investment banking revenue worldwide , one spot higher than where Lehman stood in 2007 .
The pound(s)4bn profit ascribed to the investment bank makes it Barclays ' largest segment , pound(s)1bn ahead of the retail and business banking .
Since 2010 , Barclays shares are up 11 per cent .
That trails JPMorgan 's 30 per cent but is ahead of BofA , HSBC , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
Happy anniversary , indeed .

BHP Billiton
As problems go , struggling to spend your cash is one of the better ones .
BHP Billiton yesterday unveiled a58 per cent rise in full-year operating profit and a 25 per cent increase in operating cash flow before capital expenditure to Dollars 12bn .
How is the miner allocating this largesse ?
BHP expects continued healthy demand and constrained growth in industry supply .
Next year 's planned 10 per cent increase in capex to Dollars 7.5bn therefore makes sense .
Even so , at less than 40 per cent of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , capex is low by industry standards .
There are simply not enough skilled people available to manage significantly more investment .
Another option is to return cash .
BHP increased its final dividend by28 per cent .
The pay-out ratio , however , continues to fall , although it is not out of step with its peers .
BHP also unveiled a Dollars 3bn share buy-back and could afford more .
For most companies , a dividend cut is anathema and , in a cyclical industry , it is understandable that BHP prefers buy-backs .
Chip Goodyear , chief executive , also believes that mining sector shares are undervalued .
At 9 times 2007 earnings , based on metals prices some way below current spot levels , BHP 's valuation is not stretched .
Its share price , however , would not be immune if the future turned out to be less rosy than in the miner 's optimistic macro view .
If sector shares are cheap , another option is acquisitions and BHP has proved aggressive .
Last year it was criticised for paying up for WMC Resources , but the near vertical surge in uranium prices has vindicated its judgment .
For investors , deciding how long commodity prices will remain strong is very difficult .
With more sector deals likely , the easier choice may be to back potential targets , rather than acquirers such as BHP .

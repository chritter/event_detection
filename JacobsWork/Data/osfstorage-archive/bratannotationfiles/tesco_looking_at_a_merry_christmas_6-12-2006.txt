TESCO LOOKING AT A MERRY CHRISTMAS
Tesco was optimistic about Christmas trading , as Britain 's biggest retail chain reported third-quarter underlying sales up 5.6 per cent , write Elizabeth Rigby and Tom Griggs .
Reporting underlying sales in line with expectations , Andrew Higginson , finance director , said non-food areas such as gifts and toys had been performing particularly well , with sales in these products growing at double-digits .
The retailer launched Tesco Direct this Christmas , its internet non-food shopping site and home delivery service .
It has also started trading a small selection of its clothes ranges online to see how they perform over the festive season .
Mr Higginson said he was pleased with the progress of both initiatives .
He added that Tesco had built market share in non-food products despite a " subdued market " .
Group sales , excluding petrol , grew 10.3 per cent in the 13 weeks to November , with UK sales up 8.5 per cent .
Tesco said price inflation in food continued over the quarter , particularly in fresh foods and meat - although it expects that pace to ease in the coming months .
Tesco will update on Christmas trading on January 16 .
Shares in the retail chain closed down 4p at 393 1/2p .

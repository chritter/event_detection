Vodafone acquisition of C&WW opposed by Orbis
Vodafone agreed a pound(s)1bn takeover offer for Cable& Wireless Worldwide , although it could face opposition after C&WW 's largest shareholder refused to back the deal .
Vodafone , which has been considering a bid for C&WW since February , tabled a final offer at 38p per share , valuing the group 's equity at just over pound(s)1bn .
It was the last bidder after Tata Communications withdrew its interest the previous week .
The acquisition would make Vodafone the second-largest network operator in the UK behind BT , from fourth previously , and would double the size of its corporate telecoms -business .
It would also give Vodafone ownership of one of the UK 's largest fixed-line networks that can carry its calls and data to broadcast masts for transmission to mobile phones , as well as 260,000 miles of undersea cables .
Vodafone played down any potential use of C&WW 's historic tax losses and capital allowances .
The board of C&WW recommended the offer to its shareholders , and about a fifth pledged their support , but international fund manager Orbis , the largest investor with a 19 per cent stake , said the offer undervalued the firm .
The price offered by Vodafone is almost twice that of the C&WW share price before its expression of interest , although this had dropped about three-quarters since demerger from Cable & Wireless Communications , a UK-listed overseas telecoms business .

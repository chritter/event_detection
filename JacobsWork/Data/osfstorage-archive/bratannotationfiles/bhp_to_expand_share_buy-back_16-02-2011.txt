BHP to expand share buy-back
BHP Billiton has expanded its share buy-back plan to $10bn after reporting record first-half profits on the back of boom prices for iron ore , coal and copper .
The strong operating result follows a tough few months for the miner , which has faced pressure to hand back more cash to shareholders after it failed to complete two big deals .
BHP 's decision to expand its buy-back programme from $4.8bn to $10bn comes soon after Rio Tinto said it would buy back $5bn of its shares after its full-year pre-tax profits surged by 162 per cent to $20.6bn.
Xstrata this month more than tripled its dividend as its full-year pre-tax profits rose from $1.53bn to $6.61bn.
BHP 's pre-tax profits rose from $8.88bn last time to $14.1bn in the half year to December .

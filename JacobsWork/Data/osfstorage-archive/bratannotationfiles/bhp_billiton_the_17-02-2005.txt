BHP Billiton THE
During the technology bubble , analysts would preface their questions on management conference calls by exclaiming " great quarter , guys ! " .
Similar eulogies are now features of mining company results .
As statements of fact , they are undeniable .
As share price signals , they are less than comforting .
BHP Billiton 's interims yesterday were outstanding .
Underlying operating profit rose by 95 per cent year-on-year , some 10 per cent ahead of expectations .
Higher prices drove this , while rising costs offset small volume gains .
Like Rio Tinto , BHP signalled its optimism by raising its dividend .
The new pay-out will consume about 45 per cent of free cashflow - a little below the roughly 60 per cent Rio Tinto is implicitly targeting .
Sector momentum is strong .
A supply-driven correction is unlikely given the lag between investment and production .
Short-term earnings forecasts also use commodity prices below those implied by current futures markets , suggesting further upgrades .
Yet as far as demand is concerned , expectations now extrapolate 2004 's exceptional growth - indeed market debate has moved on to the macho concept of a commodity " super cycle " .
BHP trades at a 30-50 per cent premium to brokers ' estimates of net asset value , which attempt to reflect normalised long-term prices .
Those estimates themselves have now risen by 30-40 per cent over the past year .
Absolute value is a tricky concept in mining but its link to share prices is becoming fragile .

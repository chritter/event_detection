Barclays under pressure as banks lead Footsie lower
london
Barclays was under pressure yesterday as banks led the FTSE 100 to its first decline in four days .
Shares in Barclays were in focus after RiskMetrics , the corporate governance adviser , raised concerns about its US loan book .
It said the American subsidiary " may lack the earnings wherewithal to avoid an injection of equity capital " .
Third-quarter filings cited by RiskMetrics showed non-performing loans accounting for 16.3 per cent of Barclays ' $20.6bn US portfolio .
A fifth of the loan book was in some stage of delinquency , suggesting the percentage of bad debts would rise again in the fourth quarter , it said .
" An increase in non-performing loans , coupled with declines in the fair value of loans held for sale , raises concerns given the unit 's low regulatory capital ratios , " said Michelle Flaherty , analyst .
The US unit 's capital base was " thin " and it had reported falling earnings for the past two quarters , so its capacity to handle loan losses was difficult to predict , RiskMetrics warned .
Barclays closed 2.4 per cent lower at 284 1/2 p , matching a broad weakness across the banking sector .
The FTSE 100 ended lower by 29.57 points , or 0.6 per cent , at 5,285.77.
HSBC was the biggest drag on the index , losing 2.5 per cent at 701 3/4 p.
British Airways slipped 2.2 per cent to 196 1/2 p in delayed reaction to a cabin crew strike during Christmas and the new year .
BA shares had held steady on the day the strike was announced , partly because of the company 's history of reaching last-minute settlements with unions .
" Unfortunately , we feel that the latest BA strike threat is different , " said UBS .
" We do not think BA will back down . "
UBS estimated that the 12-day strike would cost BA pound(s)275m of sales and about pound(s)40m-pound(s)50m of earnings .
For shareholders , this " seems a fair trade " given that the cost savings from cutting cabin staff would be pound(s)100m per annum , it said .
BG Group led the oil stocks , outperforming for a second day after ExxonMobil 's $31bn acquisition of XTO focused attention on gas producers .
Citigroup " buy " advice also helped BG , which was up 0.6 per cent to pound(s)10.91.
The market was pricing in a lot of risk for BG 's fields in Australia and Brazil , its main sources of growth , said Citi .
However , it reckoned a strategy meeting next month would ease those worries .
Legal & General found support on a revival of bid rumours , with Resolution once again mooted as the potential predator .
L&G closed up 2.6 per cent at 79 1/4 p and Resolution was down 0.4 per cent at 78 1/2 p.
Sector consolidation talk also underpinned Smith & Nephew , which rose 0.8 per cent to 630p .
One theory doing the rounds was that Zimmer , one of its main US rivals , may be a target for Johnson & Johnson .
Tomkins , the subject of speculative bid talk in recent weeks , added 2.5 per cent to 191 1/4 p after house broker Cazenove raised its 2009 earnings forecast by 22 per cent to reflect cost cuts and improved demand .
Traders also noted speculative interest in sector peer GKN , up 0.9 per cent to 114 3/4 p.
Elsewhere among the mid-caps , Brit Insurance gained 2.6 per cent to 185 3/4 p after UBS upgraded to " buy " .
Concerns about the insurer 's subprime liabilities looked overdone , said the broker .
A third positive tax ruling within a week helped lift Rank Group 2.8 per cent to 80 1/4 p.
Rank won the right to claim pound(s)25.9m of value added tax overpaid on slot machines between 2002 and 2005 , and the expected payment bolsters hopes that the group will restart dividends next year .
Housebuilders were weak after a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey indicated a slowdown in buyer enquiries .
Persimmon fell 2.4 per cent to 416p and Barratt Developments was down 0.6 per cent to 109 1/2 p.
Brewin Dolphin slipped 7 per cent to 138 1/2 p after it raised pound(s)14.3m with a surprise share placing to strengthen its regulatory capital base .
National Express closed 2.5 per cent lower at 182 1/4 p after banks placed the rump of its pound(s)360m rights issue at 180p per share .

Unilever
The years go by and the question remains .
Can Unilever turn itself round ?
Improvements at the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group must be acknowledged .
Pre-tax profits rose 16 per cent in the first half of 2006 ,
on 6 per cent sales growth .
Patrick Cescau , chief executive , congratulated himself yesterday on six consecutive quarters of growth .
Unilever has a slimmed-down management team and a slimmed- down portfolio of businesses now it has sold some underperformers .
It also communicates better with investors .
But the question remains .
Underlying first-half sales growth of 3.4 per cent is hardly stellar .
Peers such as Procter & Gamble , which on Wednesday said underlying second-quarter sales rose 8 per cent , managed underlying sales growth of more than 6 per cent last year .
In Europe , Unilever 's first-half underlying sales barely grew .
There is little evidence of the group being able to raise sales volumes without price cuts .
Spending on advertising and promotions is rising as a percentage of turnover - necessary to propel sales growth but one reason behind a deterioration in margins .
Underlying operating margins , 14 per cent in the second quarter , were 1 percentage point lower than a year ago .
Although some might beg to differ , Mr Cescau believes Unilever has restored competitiveness .
He has set a target of 3-5 per cent sustainable underlying sales growth , and an operating margin greater than 15 per cent by 2010 .
Such undemanding goals underline the main risk for investors - that the management does well enough to resist radical change , like a break-up , but not well enough to outperform .
Add to that another danger - that Unilever 's cash pile gets squandered on underperforming acquisitions .
Both risks suggest there is little chance that Unilever 's shares ' discount to its peers , a legacy of its inferior operating performance over a long period , will disappear .

BHP Billiton / Potash
Nothing is resolved , but BHP Billiton 's tilt at PotashCorp already looks like a classic piece of post-crisis mergers and acquisitions .
A quick scan of the year 's biggest deals , compared with those of 2007 , shows that opportunities accrue to those with the strongest balance sheets .
Investors will tolerate a measure of strategic promiscuity if it comes from a company like BHP , where operating cash flow after interest and tax was more than twice the sum of dividends and net debt in June .
Companies do not necessarily have to be better rated ; on average , the top 10 dealmakers in 2007 - many of them banks - had slightly higher credit ratings than 2010 's crop so far .
But what they do need is lots of reliable cash-generating assets , and a reputation for using the proceeds wisely .
Think triple-B News Corp , trying to mop up minorities in BSkyB , or double-B International Power , merging with GDF Suez .
Both have top-quartile returns on invested capital .
PotashCorp 's brash defence also shows that targets wo n't give in easily .
BHP was offering a 20 per cent premium over the target 's pre-bid share price .
That might have worked pre-crisis , when four-fifths of deals were agreed at a premium below 25 per cent .
But so far this year that proportion has fallen to two-thirds .
Finally , when growth is uncertain and voters are feeling nationalistic , would-be acquirers need to pitch to politicians as much as shareholders .
BHP may be able to find a way to get a different result from Canada 's " net benefit " test , but the government seems resistant to blandishments .
That 's a change ; only once before in the past 35 years has the state rejected an overseas buyer , and that was on the basis of national security .
The Canadian example may inspire other countries to be even pricklier about deals .

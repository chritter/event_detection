Vodafone set for $5.5bn dividend
Vodafone could receive an annual dividend of up to $5.5bn from its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless beginning next year , said Andy Halford , Vodafone chief financial officer , on Wednesday .
The dividend estimate is based on the $1bn a month or $12bn a year in free cash flow that Verizon Wireless generates , cash that to date has been mainly used to pay down debt .
Verizon Wireless , the largest US mobile operator , stopped paying a dividend to its corporate parents , Verizon Communications and Vodafone , in 2005 .

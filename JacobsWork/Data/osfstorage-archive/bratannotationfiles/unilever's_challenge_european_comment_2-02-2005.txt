Unilever 's challenge EUROPEAN COMMENT
Procter & Gamble 's takeover of Gillette increases pressure on Unilever , under fire for slow growth and missed forecasts .
The combined US group will overtake the Anglo-Dutch company in sales and be well placed to cut costs , develop new products and improve already superior margins .
Unilever is widely expected to appease investors at its annual results presentation on February 10 by simplifying its structure of dual co-chairmen - possibly making Antony Burgmans , the Dutch head , executive chairman , and Frenchman Patrick Cescau , his counterpart at the UK arm , chief executive .
It might not go as far as Royal Dutch / Shell in merging legal entities and share structures .
As with Shell , changes will be welcome if they make decision-making swifter and more accountable , but on their own will not restore confidence .
Unilever investors fear sales and earnings growth targets could again be downgraded .
They want evidence of a strategy to expand its brands and innovate .
The P&G-Gillette deal prompted speculation about mergers among companies such as Colgate-Palmolive of the US and UK-based Reckitt and Benckiser .
Unilever is poorly placed to take part since its underperforming shares make it hard to strike good deals , not to mention the distraction of more upheaval .
But it could see the landscape around it become more competitive .
Unless it delivers on strategy it could come under pressure for radical steps it has so far resisted - such as splitting slow- growing food from its household products business , which would be a viable merger partner .

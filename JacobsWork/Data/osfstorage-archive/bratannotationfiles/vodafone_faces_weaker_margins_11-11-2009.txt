Vodafone faces weaker margins
Fierce competition takes toll in India ; First-half pre-tax profits jump 73 %
Vodafone warned of a sharper-than-expected reduction in its profit margin in 2009-10 , as the world 's largest mobile phone operator by revenue said that fierce competition in India was taking its toll .
The group tried to reassure investors by revealing a new cost-cutting programme worth pound(s)1bn .
It also held out the possibility of a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake , in 2011 .
Last year Vodafone said a payout was unlikely until 2012 .
Shares in Vodafone closed down 2p at 135.95p after it reported revenue of pound(s)21.8bn for the six months to September 30 , an increase of 9 per cent compared with the same period last year , and pre-tax profit up 73 per cent to pound(s)5.75bn.
The first-half performance was boosted by sterling 's weakness , acquisitions and a pound(s)1.7bn impairment charge in the equivalent results for 2008-09 .
Underlying revenue fell 3 per cent and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation dropped 8 per cent .
Vodafone said in May that its ebitda margin should decline by 1.8 percentage points in 2009-10 , but yesterday it said the deterioration was now expected to be 2.1 percentage points .
The higher-than-expected decline is partly rooted in a fierce price war between mobile operators in India .
Vodafone 's Indian business recorded an ebitda margin of 24 per cent in the first half of 2009-10 , compared with 28.4 per cent in the same period last year .
Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said the Indian market had too many mobile operators - the UK group has 11 rivals .
Mr Colao said Vodafone was willing to consider buying rivals , but stressed that Indian government rules currently prevented the company from doing so .
" We will look at the opportunities and we will support consolidation , " he said .
Vodafone stuck to its guidance that it will generate pound(s)11bn to pound(s)11.8bn of operating profit in 2009-10 after saying that depreciation and amortisation charges would be lower than expected .
It added it will generate up to pound(s)6.5bn of free cash flow .
Vodafone had been seeking to cut its operating expenses by pound(s)1bn by 2011 , but the group said it was now planning to hit the target by March 2010 .
It will cut expenses by a further pound(s)1bn by March 2012 .
The interim dividend rises from 2.57p to 2.66p ; earnings per share were 9.14p ( 4.02p ) .

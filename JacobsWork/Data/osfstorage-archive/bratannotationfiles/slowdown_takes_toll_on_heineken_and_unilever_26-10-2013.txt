Slowdown takes toll on Heineken and Unilever
The slowdown in emerging markets combined with stubbornly flat developed economies to damp prospects among global consumer goods companies .
Shares in Heineken dropped sharply on Wednesday after the world 's third-largest brewer lowered its full-year profit outlook .
The Dutch brewer expects to take a hit from weakening market conditions in key developing countries such as India , Brazil , Russia and Nigeria , where beer consumption has dropped amid economic jitters and regulatory hurdles .
It is among the latest global companies to suffer from the slowdown in emerging markets , where local currencies have been battered against the dollar and euro .
Heineken said it expected net profit before exceptional items and amortisation to decline by " a low single-digit percentage " in 2013 , having forecast a result " broadly in line " with 2012 .
Unilever suffered its worst rate of quarterly sales growth in four years and issued a sales warning , blaming a slowdown in emerging markets .
On Thursday it reported underlying sales growth - which strips out acquisitions , disposals and currency fluctuations - of 3.2 per cent in its third quarter , compared with 5 per cent in the preceding two quarters .
Slowing growth in China contributed to a sharp decline in sales for drinks group Pernod Ricard .
It said revenue in the three months from July was EUR2bn , a fall of 9 per cent from the same period last year .

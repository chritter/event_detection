BHP and Rio offer iron-clad earnings
BHP Billiton ' s interim results on Wednesday and Rio Tinto ' s full-year results on Thursday will be highlights during a week of announcements by leading mining companies , writes William MacNamara .
Investors in Anglo-Australian BHP and Rio can count on earnings uplifts from the strong resurgence in industrial metal prices that gained pace throughout the six months to December .
The market is buzzing with expectation that the benchmark price of iron ore , both companies ' most profitable product in 2009 , will in the next contract year reverse most of the discount agreed in the current contract year .
But investors will judge the companies differently .
Unlike recently traumatised Rio , BHP faces the happy dilemma of abundant cash .
This has led investors to focus on the possibility of a large dividend , a share buy-back programme , rising capital expenditure , a large acquisition - or a combination of these .
Rio is likely to frame its results as a milestone in recovery after a terrible year , and investor expectations will come from a low base .
Figures from its Alcan aluminium division , which recorded a net loss in the first half and is being restructured , will be closely scrutinised .
Group debt could grab the most attention .
After a rights issue and asset sales in the second half , Rio is expected to halve net debt to about $19bn .
With cash flow also rising Rio could then make good on its interim pledge , expecting " to make a 2009 final dividend payment subject to satisfactory trading results " .

Vodafone set for service revenue dip
Vodafone is expected to report that service revenue growth turned negative in the second quarter when it announces half-year results tomorrow , writes Daniel Thomas .
This is because of fierce competitive pressures in countries hard hit by worsening economic conditions .
The telecoms group 's service revenues might have fallen 0.7 per cent in the second quarter against a year ago , with declines expected of about 12 per cent in southern European countries such as Spain and Italy .
The UK is expected to have suffered a moderate decline in service revenues , although countered by an increase of about 3 per cent in Germany .
This should bolster the northern European segment growth to about 1.6 per cent , highlighting a disparity with the south .
The strongest performance is expected from Turkey , where revenues might be as much as a fifth higher , and from its stake in the US , where Verizon Wireless has reported service revenue growth of 7.5 per cent .
First-half margins are expected to be slightly lower at about 31 per cent , with falling European margins likely to be offset by expansion in South Africa and India .
Consensus first-half earnings are put at pound(s)6.8bn , a 10 per cent decline but mostly owing to foreign exchange movements .
Stripping out this , analysts expect group ebitda to be down about 2.5 per cent in the first half .

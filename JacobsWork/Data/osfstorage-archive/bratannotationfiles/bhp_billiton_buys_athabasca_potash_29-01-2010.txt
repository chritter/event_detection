BHP Billiton buys Athabasca Potash
BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest miner , was the latest company to make a move in the market for potash and other agricultural fertiliser ingredients , as it agreed to buy a Canadian potash developer for C$341m ( $320m ) .
Yesterday 's deal follows Vale 's $3.8bn acquisition on Tuesday of Bunge 's Brazilian assets which centre on phosphate and fertilisers .
BHP 's planned acquisition of Saskatchewan-based Athabasca Potash was not the big purchase analysts had long expected it to make in the potash sector .
Potash Corp or Mosaic , two heavyweights , were more often mentioned as targets for BHP , which has a sizeable cash pile and has signalled its interest in the sector since its acquisition of Anglo Potash in 2008 .
But Athabasca brings to BHP large new acreage for potash exploration and development near its existing Jansen project .

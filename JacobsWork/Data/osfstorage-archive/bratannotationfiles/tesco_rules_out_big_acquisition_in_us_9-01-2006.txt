Tesco rules out big acquisition in US
Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive of Tesco , has ended speculation over possible deals in the US after he said the world 's fifth- largest retailer had no plans to make a large acquisition there .
However , the chief executive of the UK 's biggest retailer stopped short ofruling out entering the US market .
Tesco 's name was linked to Albertson 's late last year after the US supermarket chain put itself up for sale .
But analysts have been saying for some months that Sir Terry is unlikely to make a big bid in the US , given that his international strategy is to enter emerging markets with fragmented local competition rather than mature markets with dominant operators such as in the US .
Tesco , which will update the market on Christmas trading next week , nowgenerates just over onefifth of its sales outside the UK , from 12 overseasmarkets across Europe and Asia .

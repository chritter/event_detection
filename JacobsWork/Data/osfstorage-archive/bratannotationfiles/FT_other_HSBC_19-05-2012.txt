HSBC in law firms U-turn

HSBC has backtracked on its stipulation that mortgage borrowers must use one of just 43 law firms for legal work , following complaints about delays to the homebuying process , writes Tanya Powley .

From August , HSBC will allow any of the 1,419 law firms accredited with the Law Society 's Conveyancing Quality Scheme ( CQS ) to carry out legal work for the bank and for the borrower .

The move follows months of complaints from homebuyers and lawyers about long delays and the breakdown of property chains due to the bank 's announcement in January that customers would have to use their reduced solicitor panel - or use their own solicitor and pay an extra fee of £192 ( £ 160 , plus VAT ) to cover HSBC 's legal work .

Homebuyers said the lender 's insistence on using a small panel of firms has caused months of delays to purchases . 
Customers have described the process a " nightmare " , causing added stress and worry .

Other homebuyers said they nearly missed out on the stamp duty holiday for properties purchased up to the value of £ 250,000 , which ended on March 24 , as a result of the delays .

But , while HSBC 's decision to allow CQS accredited firms will dramatically widen the choice for homebuyers from August , it will not help the position of those currently buying a property with the lender .

Brokers said the problem has been accentuated by HSBC offering competitive mortgage deals , particulary for first-time buyers .

" HSBC has been plagued with service issues and delays , partly caused by a limited conveyancing panel and also by offering some of the ' best-buy ' mortgage rates on the market , " said Adrian Anderson of Anderson Harris , a mortgage broker .

Anderson noted that over the past few months his firm has seen a significant increase in homebuyers in " desperation " because they are in danger of losing their property .

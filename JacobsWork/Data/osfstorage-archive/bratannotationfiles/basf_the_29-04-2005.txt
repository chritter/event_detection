BASF THE
BASF , the world 's largest chemicals group , rather surprisingly also sells wine .
But , in spite of surging profits , chairman Jurgen Hambrecht seems determined to avoid any hint of drunken euphoria .
In March , Mr Hambrecht conservatively forecast flat 2005 operating income .
Yesterday 's first-quarter numbers , showing operating profits up 40 per cent and product prices up 13 per cent , give the lie to that conservatism .
But BASF remains anxious to keep expectations well under control .
There is a reason for the Teutonic phlegm .
Management wants investors to believe BASF is not just a cyclical play , although its valuation - at an 8 per cent discount to the sector - suggests the market remains unconvinced .
The upturn in the chemicals cycle is lasting longer than usual but it can not carry on forever .
And BASF believes the European and North American market will grow more slowly than gross domestic product until 2015 .
To counter this , it is pursuing cost-cutting measures as well as investment in markets such as China .
But if management wants to persuade the market that BASF is more than just a cyclical punt , it must put its money where its mouth is .
So far , free cash flow has been used to finance share buybacks and dividend increases .
But with its cash pile forecast to reach - on conservative estimates - over Euros 1bn by the end of the year , BASF must start making effective downstream acquisitions as well as returning cash to investors .

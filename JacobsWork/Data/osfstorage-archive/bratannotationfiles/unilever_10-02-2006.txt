Unilever
Unilever 's latest announcement conjures up the image of a get- fit fanatic , who gulps Slim-Fast but can not resist the odd dollop of ice-cream .
As part of the rationalisation of the consumer conglomerate 's unwieldy portfolio , the bulk of its underperforming European frozen foods business will be sold .
Other good news included a 5 per cent year-on-year increase in fourth-quarter like- for-like group sales .
Unfortunately , last year also witnessed a big rise in advertising and promotional spending .
Hence , full-year and fourth-quarter underlying margins fell by 80 and 130 basis points , respectively .
Four-fifths of the extra money went on advertising , rather than shorter-lived promotions .
That offers some comfort that the money is being spent wisely .
Time will tell .
The management 's overall strategy is sound , but licking Unilever into shape will take time .
Yet the share price has risen 19 per cent since the start of 2005 , even as consensus forecasts for 2006 earnings have fallen by 7 per cent .
Such optimism is a consistent feature of European food stocks ( 55 per cent of Unilever 's group sales fall into this camp ) .
This year , sector earnings are expected to grow by 9 per cent , despite having averaged just 3 per cent since 2000 .
Including buybacks , Unilever yields about 5 per cent on 2006 forecasts .
If it secures Euros 1.5bn from a frozen foods disposal , and returns the after-tax proceeds to shareholders , that rises to a more compelling 7 per cent .
There is no guarantee Unilever will do this , but in the interests of keeping investors on board , it should .

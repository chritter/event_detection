Tesco at a discount Alison Smith - Lombard
So much for record Pounds 2bn profit , gangbuster sales growth and a market share above 30 per cent .
While Tesco causes fear and loathing almost everywhere else on the high street , its shares have trailed the food retailing sector by 1.6 per cent this year .
As performances go , that is not much better than Wm Morrison , and worse than J Sainsbury .
The sector has been buoyed by bid premiums for Somerfield but that hardly explains why Tesco 's shares have fallen in absolute terms .
One theory is that Sir Terry Leahy 's paranoia about complacency has infected investors .
They fear Tesco will eventually be cut down to size either by government regulation or a consumer backlash in the home market , from where it derives 80 per cent of sales .
Another is that Tesco will wage an overly aggressive acquisition campaign overseas , where its sales record to date has been mixed and returns have only recently begun to improve .
The pessimism , of course , could stem from the company 's own conservatism about this year 's outlook .
However , most analysts expect underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 per cent , which would be up to Pounds 900m more than Tesco officially budgeted for .
Some already have their eye on Pounds 3bn in profit in coming years .
Tesco makes no attempt to foster such speculation .
At least as far as its profit go , its approach is to play it down - that way it gets less scrutiny .
With such paranoia guiding the company , its overseas ambitions should remain realistic , making this a good long-term buying opportunity .
Especially for a juggernaut such as Tesco , it is better to play the shrinking violet than the tall poppy .

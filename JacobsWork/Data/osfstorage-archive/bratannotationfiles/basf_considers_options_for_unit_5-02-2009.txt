BASF considers options for unit
BASF , the world 's largest chemicals maker , is looking to sell or find a partner for its unit that makes chemicals for the textile and leather-goods industry .
The German group , which is fighting the effects of the global economic slump , said that the strategic review of the unit was a reaction to " low market growth and competitive pressure " .
The move is consistent with its goal of reducing exposure to low-margin bulk chemical production .
The leather and textile chemicals unit saw revenues of around EUR400m in 2007 and employed 1,300 people .
Its big rivals in the leather market are Germany 's Lanxess and Clariant of Switzerland .
At the same time BASF announced a small internal reorganisation as it prepares to integrate Ciba , a Swiss chemicals maker , for which it made a takeover offer in September .
BASF 's performance products division will in the future contain a new paper chemicals unit , into which many of the Ciba operations will fall once the takeover integration gets going in the second half of 2009 .

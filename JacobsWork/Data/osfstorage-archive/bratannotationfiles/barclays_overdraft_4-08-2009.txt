Barclays overdraft
Buried in the Barclays results document was the tantalising detail on page 110 about a director who has a good enough credit rating to be allowed a hefty pound(s)800,000 overdraft .
The unnamed director was , of course , paying standard commercial rates on what is not the average person 's standard overdraft .
Also rating a mention was a less eyebrow-raising pound(s)500,000 mortgage to " a key member of management " .

Tesco ( TSCO )
Nine months into a plan to overhaul the UK business and one year after its profit warning , Tesco 's Christmas sales figures look relatively underwhelming .
In the six weeks to January 5 , group like-for-like sales excluding petrol were up 0.3 per cent .
UK like-for-like sales , excluding petrol and stripping out sales from Clubcard vouchers , were broadly in line with expectations , rising 1.4 per cent , boosted by better food and online sales .
But broker Seymour Pierce points out that this is a poor return considering Tesco has invested 1 per cent of its tight margin this financial year to achieve it , following a profit warning a year ago after the group 's dire performance at Christmas 2011 .
The supermarket is also struggling internationally .
Like-for-like sales in Asia and central Europe continued to decline , while in the US , where Tesco is reviewing its Fresh & Easy business , like-for-like sales fell 2.1 per cent .
A cut-price sale of the business is widely expected .
Managers say the tough trading conditions will continue to the year-end , particularly in central Europe .
There are signs that Tesco 's six-point plan to improve its UK business is starting to pay off , but inflation and equally tough trading conditions are forecast this year , especially in its international businesses .

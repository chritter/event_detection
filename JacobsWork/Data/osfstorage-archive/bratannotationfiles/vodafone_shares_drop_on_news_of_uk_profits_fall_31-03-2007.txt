Vodafone shares drop on news of UK profits fall
Vodafone 's shares fell more than 4 per cent yesterday after the mobile phone group revealed how the profitability of its UK business had been hurt by a dash for top-line growth .
Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , tried to calm investor nerves at the end of an all-day presentation to analysts by stressing the UK was the group 's most competitive market and he did not foresee the same challenges elsewhere .
The shares dipped 5.5 per cent in mid-afternoon trading after the disclosure that the UK margin on earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation had declined from 34 per cent in the six months to March 31 last year to 26.6 per cent in the five months to February 28 this year .
The shares closed down4.3 per cent at 135.5p.
It was the largest fall since November 2005 .
Mr Sarin sought to allay investor concern by drawing attention to Vodafone 's guidance last May that the group 's ebitda margin would fall by one percentage point in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 .
" We continue to believe here in Europe that we will see dilution of margin gradually , " said Mr Sarin .
" Equally , we do not see a freefall in margin . "
Vodafone 's UK business has sacrificed its ebitda margin during the last nine months and instead focused on revenue growth .
Vodafone was forced to change its strategy because 0 , Orange and T-Mobile had been cutting the prices of their mobile packages .
Cuts in Vodafone 's tariffs have bolstered revenue growth , partly by attracting new customers .
Service revenue growth increased 5 per cent in January and February compared with the same period last year .
But analysts expressed concern about the ebitda margin .
" The UK margins are weaker than expected and , while revenue growth is stronger , we doubt it will be able to sustain this higher growth rate for long , " said Martin Mabbutt , analyst at Nomura , who has a " buy " rating on the stock .

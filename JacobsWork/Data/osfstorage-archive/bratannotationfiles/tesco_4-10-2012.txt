Tesco
" Every little helps , " says Tesco 's tagline as it tries to convince shoppers that it goes the extra mile to help them out .
It might be hoping that investors take a similar view .
Yesterday 's first-half results were atrocious , with profits for the UK company down in almost all areas of the business .
But buried in the statement was a small number that could point to bigger improvements ahead .
The rate of decline in UK like-for-like sales slowed in the second quarter against the first - from 1.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent - as a turnround plan that involves back-to-basics wisdom such as low prices , more welcoming stores and higher staffing took effect .
That is a decent start but it can not yet be counted as evidence that January 's profit warning was a blip rather than the start of a long , Carrefour-style decline .
The self-help measures might well help Tesco to dig itself out of its current hole - and a decent update from J Sainsbury suggests the UK does not have to be a dismal place for a food retailer - but other problems abound .
Demand in China is failing to keep up with new space being added , opening hours in Korea have been forcibly restricted and the US operation is still a worry .
Tesco 's response has been to rein in spending .
The capital expenditure-to-sales ratio is likely to fall to less than 5 per cent next year .
In 2009 it was higher than 8 per cent .
That will bring its ratio closer to peers such as Walmart , Carrefour and Metro .
That is a smart move in tough conditions but it does not exactly make for a thrilling investment proposition .
On 10 times forecast earnings , Tesco is at a discount to the likes of Sainsbury ( 12 ) and Walmart ( 14 ) .
But Tesco is no longer the growth story it once was and bargain hunters should hold off until there is more evidence of a recovery than one quarter of improvement in like-for-like sales numbers .

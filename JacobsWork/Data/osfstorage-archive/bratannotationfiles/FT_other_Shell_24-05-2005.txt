North Sea gas find for Shell NEWS DIGEST

Royal Dutch Shell said it had made a " significant discovery " of gas at its Onyx South West prospect in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea .

The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said the Onyx discovery could approach 60bn standard cubic metres of produceable gas , subject to determining the limits of the deposit .

Shell declined to put any figure on the size of the discovery , but Rien Herber , its exploration director for Europe , said : " There are indications that we are dealing with a significant find . "

If confirmed that at the size provisionally suggested by Norwegian authorities , Onyx would count as a " Big Cat " for Shell , meaning that its share amounted to at least 100m barrels per day of oil equivalent . 
Shell is aiming to drill 15-20 Big Cat prospects in each of 2005 and 2006 .

Shell , operator of Onyx , has a 30 per cent interest , as does Norway 's Petoro . 
Total of France and Statoil of Norway have 20 per cent each .

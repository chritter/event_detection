Vodafone
Mixed messages rarely make investors comfortable .
Interim results at Vodafone were full of them .
On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1.4 per cent year on year in the second quarter .
That was partly a result of weak results in Spain and Italy where regulatory price pressures combined with poor economic trends ( and a further pound(s)6bn in impairments ) .
Few surprises there .
But Vodafone 's revenue growth also slowed from first-quarter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3.2 per cent decline in the UK .
Result : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009-10 .
First-half earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , at pound(s)6.6bn , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the ebitda margin slipped to 30.5 per cent , compared with 31.2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) .
Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent-owned Verizon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $8.5bn dividend to its two parents .
The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade-off for an earlier payout , and Vodafone will return pound(s)1.5bn to investors via a share buyback .
The non-European interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1.8 times ebitda .
So full-year guidance was held , albeit with small refinements .
Like its peers , Vodafone has a well-articulated vision based around consumers ' appetite for data-based services , businesses ' need for comprehensive account management , and a portfolio of emerging market interests .
It has also set a pound(s)300m cost-saving target for 2013-14 .
But until the European outlook clears , its shares - down 2 per cent yesterday , implying an enterprise value to 2013-14 ebitda ratio of eight - may struggle to make progress .

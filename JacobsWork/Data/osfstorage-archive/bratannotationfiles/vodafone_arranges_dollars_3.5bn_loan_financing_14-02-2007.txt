VODAFONE ARRANGES Dollars 3.5bn LOAN FINANCING
Vodafone has arranged Dollars 3.5bn of 18-month loans through a consortium of five banks , despite saying it would self-fund its acquisition of a controlling stake in Indian mobile group Hutchison Essar , writes Paul J . Davies .
The loans are underwritten by BNP Paribas , Banco Santander , Lloyds TSB , Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS .
UBS also advised Vodafone on the deal .
However , one person close to the company said the financing arrangement should not be seen as allied to the Hutchison Essar purchase and that it was part of a broader set of corporate financing arrangements aimed at ensuring Vodafone had access to the best-priced debt whenever it was needed .
One banker involved said the company would not need any external financing for the Hutchison Essar deal unless Essar , the Indian group that owns 33 per cent of Hutchison Essar , decided to sell its minority stake to the UK company .
Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , said he hoped Essar would retain its stake .
Separately , Moody 's the rating agency , yesterday put Vodafone 's A3 credit rating on review for a possible downgrade .

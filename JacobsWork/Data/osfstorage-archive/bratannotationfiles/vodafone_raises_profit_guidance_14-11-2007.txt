Vodafone raises profit guidance
By ANDREW EDGECLIFFE-JOHNSON and ANDREW PARKER
Vodafone yesterday underlined its confidence by raising its guidance on operating profit for 2007-08 , as it claimed that revenue from people using mobile phones for web surfing was finally starting to take off .
Arun Sarin , chief executive , hailed how the UK group had seen a 45 per cent increase in revenue from mobile data functions such as downloading music .
Such growth is bolstering Vodafone 's top line in its core European markets .
Mr Sarin also said the revenue situation in Europe could improve next year because of fewer punitive interventions by regulators compared with 2007-08 .
Vodafone yesterday reported half-year results that came in ahead of market expectations .
Shares in the world 's largest mobile group by revenue closed up 13.7p at 195.7p.
Revenue for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 17bn ( Dollars 35bn ) , up 4.4 per cent on an underlying basis compared with the same period last year , and adjusted operating profit of Pounds 5.2bn , up 6.1 per cent .
Vodafone recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6bn , compared with a loss of Pounds 3.3bn in the first half of 2006-07 .
That improvement was principally because Vodafone wrote down the value of some European businesses last year .
The group raised its guidance on adjusted operating profit for 2007-08 from between Pounds 9.3bn and Pounds 9.8bn to between Pounds 9.5bn and Pounds 9.9bn.
Mr Sarin highlighted how Vodafone Essar , the Indian mobile business bought for Pounds 5.5bn in May , was delivering revenue growth of 53 per cent , and signing up 1.6m new customers each month .
Vodafone 's businesses in emerging markets currently contribute about 25 per cent of the group 's revenue , but recorded growth of 16 per cent on an underlying basis in the first half .
In Europe , revenue growth was 2 per cent .

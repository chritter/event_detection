Tesco
Tesco investors knew that the drastically reduced spending power of UK consumers was always going to make for a tough first half .
The company 's interims were resilient enough , but it is during a downturn that the UK supermarket group 's breathless expansion will be put to its severest test .
Tesco 's policy seems to be working .
The UK business , its main earnings engine , increased trading profit by 5 per cent to pound(s)1.3bn on sales 6 per cent higher .
Strip out the effect of new stores , however , and sales excluding petrol and value added tax fell by 0.5 per cent , mostly in the second quarter .
So much for the past .
The outlook is gloomier : Tesco predicts flat profit in the second half from a year ago .
Never mind .
Tesco 's Asian and European operations , where first-half trading profit rose 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively , should continue to ease the pain .
Its earnings diversity gives it an edge over UK peers J Sainsbury , Wm Morrison and Asda .
However , its US business Fresh & Easy continues to fire blanks .
The division is expected to break even in the next two years .
For now , Tesco 's biggest concern is its bank .
Group trading profit , which rose by 3.7 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , would have been 4.5 percentage points higher without a pound(s)57m one-off provision for personal protection insurance mis-selling claims .
Given the worsening UK market conditions , and Tesco 's target of boosting the return on capital employed to 15 per cent by 2015 from 13 per cent last year , it needs to slow its pace of capital expenditure from its range of 5-5.5 per cent of revenue .
This would give it the flexibility to cut debt and boost shareholder returns .
Its shares , trading on a multiple of 11 times forward earnings - a 5 per cent discount to pure UK play Wm Morrison - suggest investors still fear that Tesco is lavishing cash on a race with no winner .

Barclays
Barclays ' first-quarter profit surged by almost 47 per cent , yet its shares slid by more than 6 per cent yesterday .
In part , the strong fixed income , currencies and commodities ( FICC ) performances from Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank had stoked expectations that Barclays Capital would also shoot the lights out .
But instead , BarCap 's revenue was down 26 per cent on last year , and top-line income from FICC was almost 40 per cent lower , compared with the roughly 10 per cent fall at other investment banks .
Credit Suisse 's recent first-quarter results disappointed for much the same reason .
But investors ' concerns about Barclays do not end there .
Although Barclays ' pre-tax profits rose by 47 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , helped by a sharp fall in impairments , BarCap accounted for more than four-fifths of them .
Retail banking still struggles .
This was not as lop-sided as Deutsche Bank , where investment banking contributed 93 per cent of pre-tax profits , but does little to dispel investor concerns that Barclays relies unduly on volatile investment banking .
Barclays itself targets a one-third / two-thirds split between BarCap 's and the retail bank 's share of profit .
Given that the market conditions of the first two quarters of last year are unlikely to be repeated , another way to see BarCap 's revenue decline is as setting a more normal quarterly run-rate of pound(s)3.5bn-pound(s)4bn , Credit Suisse notes .
That might herald the greater balance that Barclays seeks .
Yet BarCap , after a costly hiring spree , insists its latest performance represents a baseline .
Either way , investors are not convinced : Barclays ' shares , at about 0.8 times book value , trade at a dismal discount even to part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group , a pure retail banking play on the UK 's fragile recovery .
For all its sparkle , BarCap does nothing for Barclays ' rating .

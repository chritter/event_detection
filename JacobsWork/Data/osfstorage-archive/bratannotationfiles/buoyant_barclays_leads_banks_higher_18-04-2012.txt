Buoyant Barclays leads banks higher
LONDON
Barclays led banks to the top of the London leaderboard after positive broker comment on the stock helped lift the mood across a beaten-down sector .
The stock rose 4.6 per cent to 220.6p and , after two sessions of sector losses , there were also gains for its peers , which were left looking like good value .
Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.8 per cent to 25.2p and Lloyds Banking Group was 4.2 per cent stronger at 31p .
HSBC was 2.4 per cent higher at 554.1p.
Overall , the FTSE 100 was 1.8 per cent higher at 5,766.95 , a rise of 100.67 points , supported by a strong start to Wall Street trading .
The recovery in risk appetite was strong enough to bring heavily weighted base metals stocks into the rally .
Chilean copper miner Antofagasta was 5 per cent stronger at pound(s)11.76 , the best single rise of the day .
But two of London 's biggest retailers missed out on the broad-based gains after poorly received trading updates .
They made the heaviest losses of only eight FTSE 100 stocks to register overall falls .
Marks and Spencer said fourth-quarter like-for-like sales fell 0.7 per cent , confounding hopes of a rise of up to 1.6 per cent in the revenue taken at stores open for at least a year .
Shares in M&S , one of the most widely held stocks on the FTSE 100 , fell 2.5 per cent to 358.7p , the second-biggest loss on the benchmark index .
Burberry Group was the biggest single faller after its rise in sales for the second half of the year met forecasts but could not extend a strong run in advance of the release of the results .
Shares in the stock , which is highly active in emerging Asian markets , fell 5.9 per cent to pound(s)14.92 , trimming its gains for the year-to-date to 23.2 per cent .

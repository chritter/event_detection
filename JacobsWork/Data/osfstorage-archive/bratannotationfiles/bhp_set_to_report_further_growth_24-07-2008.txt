BHP set to report further growth
BHP Billiton is on course to report its sixth consecutive year of profits growth after the Anglo-Australian mining group 's annual production figures showed bumper results from its petroleum , iron ore , man-ga-nese and copper operations .
BHP , already the world 's largest mining group , is attempting to become an even more powerful global force as it attempts to secure rival Rio Tinto via a hostile all-share takeover offer worth about $170bn ( pound(s)85m ) .
The outcome of the takeover will not be known until next year as BHP seeks regulatory clearance .
Record demand for iron ore and coal from fast-growing nations led by China and India , and record prices for oil , will contribute billions in dollars in profits to BHP in the financial period ended June 30 .
BHP last year reported net profits up by more than a quarter to $13.4bn.
Ahead of yesterday 's bumper production report , analysts from ABN Amro in Australia had forecast record profits of $16.1bn for the year ended last month .
Iron ore production rose 15 per cent and annual crude oil and condensate 27 per cent , while total petroleum products rose 13 per cent to 130m barrels of oil equivalent .
Shares in BHP fell 2p to pound(s)16.16.

Winning ways at Tesco
Bookies sometimes offer odds for those who want to " bet without the favourite " - a wager on who will come second to an obvious winner .
A gamble on Tesco 's rivals , judging from yesterday 's figures on current trading , is even less certain .
Not only is Tesco ahead , its tactics are probably biting into the market share of the other runners .
In the first five weeks of its financial year ( since February 23 ) , like-for-like sales grew at 4 per cent .
The latest British Retail Consortium figures indicate overall retail sales fell 1.6 per cent in March , with sales of food ( Tesco 's strongpoint ) slowing .
Even if Tesco 's non-food offering comes under pressure , it has greater flexibility than specialist retailers to tailor its range , and more firepower than other supermarkets to adjust its food promotions to demand .
The shares trade at a multiple of 15 times 2008-09 forecast earnings .
That 's an attractive price for the favourite .

Kabel investors approve EUR7.7bn Vodafone takeover
The EUR7.7bn takeover of Kabel Deutschland by Vodafone won shareholder approval when votes in favour of the deal passed a crucial 75 per cent hurdle last night .
The lengthy process of collecting and verifying votes meant uncertainty had persisted over whether the deal would be approved .
People with knowledge of the transaction said the key threshold was reached late yesterday afternoon .
There was nervousness among shareholders ahead of the vote given the relatively high threshold , even if there were none who had voiced opposition .
Vodafone will reveal the final vote tally on Monday but said last night that the 75 per cent minimum acceptance condition had been met .
The deal is a key strategic move in Vodafone 's ambition to create a multiple-service telecoms and cable business in the largest European markets .
Kabel will add additional media services for Vodafone to sell to its customers alongside mobile calls , while its extensive fixed line network will make it cheaper to carry calls .
Vodafone is in line for a huge payout once the $130bn deal to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless completes early next year .
Part of this will be used to cover the acquisition of Kabel , although Vodafone will still be left with a large war chest for more acquisitions .
Companies linked with Vodafone include Fastweb in Italy and Ono in Spain .
But the likelihood of a much larger deal with John Malone 's Liberty Global could recede given the now-large overlap in their businesses in Germany .

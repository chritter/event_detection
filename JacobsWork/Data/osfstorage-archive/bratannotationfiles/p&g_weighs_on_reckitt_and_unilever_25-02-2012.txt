P&G weighs on Reckitt and Unilever
LONDON
Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever fell to the bottom of a stubbornly neutral FTSE 100 yesterday , spooked by the implications of an ambitious restructuring at their American rival Procter & Gamble .
The consumer products makers were under pressure on concerns about the potential impact on the sector of P&G 's plans to boost its performance , especially in faster-growing emerging markets .
Unilever fell 1.9 per cent to pound(s)20.50 , while Reckitt declined 2.3 per cent to pound(s)34.21 , the second-biggest loss on the index .
The FTSE 100 remained unable to extend the seven-month highs priced into it last week ahead of the confirmation of a second bail-out deal for Greece .
The benchmark index ticked just 3 points higher on the session to 5,935.13 , a gain of just 0.1 per cent .
Over the week , it made a modest rise of 0.5 per cent .
Hammerson was among the best gainers as traders reacted well to its restructuring plans .
It finished 3.7 per cent higher at 400.1p , also helped by a 7.1 per cent rise in annual net asset value per share of 530p .
Services company Capita lingered on the leaderboard after it reported a 6 per cent rise in profit for 2011 .
It rose 4.1 per cent to 747.1p yesterday , a rise of 9.4 per cent since the results were released on Thursday .
A profit warning from Lloyds Banking Group unnerved traders yesterday , making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 .
The bank 's shares , which have rallied more than 60 per cent during the past three months , fell 2.3 per cent on the session to 36p .

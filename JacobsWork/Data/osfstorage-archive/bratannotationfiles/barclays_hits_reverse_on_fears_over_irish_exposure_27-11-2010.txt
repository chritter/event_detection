Barclays hits reverse on fears over Irish exposure
LONDON
Barclays was among the fallers on Friday as the sovereign debt crisis sent London markets sliding .
Shares in Barclays hit their lowest since July on concerns about its loan exposures to Ireland , Portugal , Spain and Italy , which totalled pound(s)94bn at the end of the third quarter .
However , Chris Lucas , Barclays finance director , stuck with guidance that 2010 loan impairments would be lower by 30 per cent on last year .
In a presentation at JPMorgan Cazenove , he also suggested that 2011 would be " slightly better " than 2010 .
" Asset quality metrics continue to screen slightly better for them , even in regions such as Spain , " said JPMorgan .
Still , Barclays ended 3.2 per cent lower at 259 3/4 p.
That matched falls across the financial sector amid fears that the European Union was ready to make lenders to Irish banks take a loss on their investments .
Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 5.3 per cent to 38 1/2 p and Lloyds Banking Group was down 4.4 per cent to 61 3/4 p.
Insurers were also hit , with Aviva 2.5 per cent weaker at 369 3/4 p and RSA Insurance off 1.8 per cent to 121p .
The FTSE 100 ended down 0.5 per cent , or 30.23 points , at 5,668.70.
Over the week the index fell 1.7 per cent .
Centrica led the utilities lower on Friday , falling 2.6 per cent to 316p , after UK energy regulator Ofgem launched a review of the retail energy market .
While findings are not due until March , Centrica 's estimated retail margin of 9-10 per cent did not look sustainable , Deutsche Bank said .
Downgrades from Investec and Merrill Lynch sent Kingfisher down 2 per cent to 244 1/2 p ahead of a trading update next week .
BT Group was up 4.4 per cent to 172 1/4 p on news it would sell part of its stake in Indian IT services business Tech Mahindra , a deal worth about pound(s)61m at Friday 's prices .
The stock was also helped by Merrill Lynch research looking at BT 's programmes to pay down its debt and pension deficit .
" Our base case scenario suggests BT 's share price could go up 36 per cent over the next 2 1/2 years if BT simply delivers on current forecasts , " Merrill concluded .
Capital Shopping Centres gained 5.3 per cent to 401p on speculation that the indicative bid approach from Simon Property Group may shake out other interest , such as from fellow shareholder Westfield .
Potential buyers have until December 20 to block Capital 's deal to buy Manchester 's Trafford Centre and give up to a quarter of the company to its current owner Peel Holdings .
Pump maker Weir Group rose 2.8 per cent to pound(s)17.56 after a recommendation from Morgan Stanley , which set a pound(s)20 target price .
Traders also noted demand from tracker funds ahead of Weir 's addition to MSCI 's indices on Tuesday .
Compass Group was up 1.3 per cent to 555p as RBS argued that the caterer had more than pound(s)1bn available for acquisitions or share buy-backs .
" We anticipate marked earnings upgrades , " it said in a " buy " note .
Telecity , the data warehouse , jumped 6.2 per cent to 741 1/2 p on " buy " advice from Collins Stewart with a 560p price target .
Internet traffic would increase a further 40-fold over the next 10 years and Telecity was among the best technology-agnostic ways to play this continued structural growth , it said .
Ocado , the grocery delivery business , rose 4.1 per cent to 151p as a theory about takeover interest from Morrison supermarkets helped put the squeeze on short sellers .
" We would be surprised , " said Shore Capital .
" Such a deal would be heavily dilutive for Morrison 's earnings and capital returns . "
Betfair lost 4.8 per cent to pound(s)14 after UBS started coverage with a " sell " rating .
It said the opening of international markets would be a long and uncertain process and , in the meantime , high levels of IT and marketing investment were likely to weigh on profitability .

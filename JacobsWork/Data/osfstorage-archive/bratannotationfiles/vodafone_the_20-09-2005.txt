Vodafone THE
It is a long way from 2000 .
At its annual strategy meeting yesterday , Vodafone enthused about text messaging among the over- 45s .
But if the rhetoric has deflated , 3G remains Vodafone 's best opportunity .
Average revenue per user for 3G customers is 145 per cent higher than for 2G .
Customers upgrading to Vodafone 's 3G " Live " portal show a 16 per cent ARPU uplift .
Vodafone has a modest lead in products and network capability .
Across western Europe it takes about 20 per cent of net customer additions , but 40 per cent of net new 3G adds .
The snag is that at its rate of 1.1m proportionate 3G additions each quarter , it would take 35 years to penetrate the existing user base .
This conservatism reflects experience in Japan , Hong Kong and Portugal .
There , incumbents ' margins have been hit by up to 5 percentage points by 3G handset subsidies and the cost from running two technologies .
Organic sales growth is an impressive 9 per cent , helped by emerging markets .
But in Vodafone 's big European markets , growth now tracks nominal gross domestic product .
Regulatory price cuts and competitor relaunches , for example in Germany , can make these mature units quite volatile too , although Vodafone 's sheer size helps to dilute any upsets .
Vodafone 's strategy and balance sheet management hover between the two poles of growth stock and utility .
Until the company itself feels more comfortable with its next product cycle , it seems likely its rating will hover there too .

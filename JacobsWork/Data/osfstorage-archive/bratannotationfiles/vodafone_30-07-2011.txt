Vodafone
Talk about having the last laugh .
Verizon has long looked to its successful US Verizon Wireless business to prop up its declining fixed-line earnings .
And it has long eyed the 45 per cent stake in the unit owned by Vodafone .
But having spent six years trying to starve out the UK operator by freezing dividend payments , it has now given up .
Unable to cover its own dividend , Verizon has been forced to declare a $10bn payment from the wireless unit , $4.5bn of which goes straight to Vodafone .
In response , the latter 's share price jumped up 5 per cent on Friday .
The problem for both companies is that multibillion-dollar decisions have been made based purely on the desire for dividends .
Their payment means nothing to a company 's valuation .
The frequent complaints by many Vodafone shareholders at the lack of dividends from Verizon Wireless are confusing , as the unit 's cash has been put to good use paying down debt .
That makes the resumption of dividends more of a moral victory than a financial one .
After all , there was never any uncertainty the investment was going to provide a return ; it could always have been sold if necessary .
Even if Verizon Wireless paid Vodafone $4.5bn a year for the last six years , the $27bn received would merely have reduced the value of the US investment - currently about $70bn - by the same amount .
Vodafone 's chief executive Vittorio Colao had much pressure on him to return cash to investors , but his decision to return pound(s)2bn of the dividend to shareholders is not a cave-in .
His company is in great financial shape and there are few acquisition targets .
He will also be happy that the illogical gap between Vodafone 's sum-of-the-parts valuation and its depressed market capitalisation has narrowed - even if it occurred for the wrong reason .
